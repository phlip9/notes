randomness)\nExpectimax is like Minimax but for non-deterministic games.\nHave Player1, Player2, and Chance node levels in our search tree.\nUnlike minimax which only requires evaluation functions to preserve ordering, expectimax requires that our evaluation function $f(\\text{leaf-state})$ must be a Positive Linear Operator on the win probability (so it must also preserves positive-ness) to be optimal.\n\nRecall: the evaluation function scores terminal states (game end) and depth-pruned states (states exceeding a depth limit).\n\n\n\nPruning + State &amp; Q-State Cache\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSee also: 2007 - Effective Use of Transposition Tables in Stochastic Game Tree Search\nFor a chance node, we're taking the mean of each possible outcome.\nAs we explore branches from the chance node, our upper and lower bound estimates of the mean slowly tighten, until we explore all branches and the mean becomes an exact value.\nWe can think of the lower bounds as taking the current exact value plus the sum of the rest of the probabilities times the worst possible outcome. Likewise the upper bound is the current exact value plus the sum of the rest of the probabilities times the best possible value.\nWith a naive alpha-beta pruning and q-state caching strategy, we might prune a branch but still cache the current estimate. However, this would only be a valid estimate for another path if the alpha-beta bounds are tighter.\nInstead of just recording a single value, we record an enum with two cases\nCase 1: the exact value, meaning we've fully explored all branches of this chance node.\nCase 2: an upper and lower bound and a thunk(?) to resume exploration of this node, meaning there are still more branches to explore.\nIn this way, we don't lose any information when we place a q-state into the cache. If another path has looser alpha-beta bounds (maybe we hit the q-state again on a higher level in the next branch) then it can explore the q-state some more before it decides to possibly prune or not.\nWhat about min- and max-state caching?\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWe presumably do the same thing with only upper xor lower bounds resp. vs exact value plus resumable exploration thunk.\nHow do we prune?\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nAt a given chance node we have the bound $[\\alpha, \\beta]$ from our parent node, showing the best case known for the max (alpha) and best case known for the min (beta).\nAs we explore this chance node, we continually refine down our current best estimate bounds $[a, b]$ as we explore more branches. As soon as we see the bound intervals $[a, b]$ and $[\\alpha, \\beta]$ no longer intersect, we can prune.\nAppendix\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nPositive Linear Operator\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nsource: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Positive_linear_operator\nFor scalar spaces, positive linear operators are functions of the form:\n\\[\nf(x) = a_1 \\cdot x + a_2 \\qquad \\text{where } a_1 &gt; 0\n\\]\nMore generally, let $(X, \\le_X)$ and $(Y, \\le_Y)$ be vector spaces with preorder operators $\\le_X$ and $\\le_Y$ resp.\nLet $f \\;:\\; X \\mapsto Y$ be a function from $X$ to $Y$. The function $f$ is a positve linear operator if:\n\nIt preserves positive-ness, i.e., positive elements in $X$ are all mapped to positive elements in $Y$.\nIt preserves the preordering (homomorphic?), i.e., if $x_1 \\le_X x_2$, then $f(x_1) \\le_Y f(x_2)$.\n\nFormally, $f$ is a positive linear operator if\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\t\\forall \\; x_1,\\, x_2 \\in X, &amp;\\text{ where } 0 \\le_X x_1, x_2 \\; :  &amp; \\\\\n\t\\\\\n\t&amp;0 \\le_Y f(x_1) \\text{ and } 0 \\le_Y f(x_2) &amp;\\text{(1.) preserves positive-ness} \\\\\n\t&amp;f(x_1) \\le_Y f(x_2) &amp;\\text{(2.) preserves the preordering}\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nFor example, consider a simple zero-sum game where agents $A$ and $B$ have utility functions\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\tU_A\n\t&amp;= p_w \\cdot r + (1 - p_w) \\cdot -r \\\\\n\t&amp;= r \\cdot (2 \\cdot p_w - 1) \\\\\n\t&amp;= 2 r \\cdot p_w - r \\\\\n\tU_B\n\t&amp;= (1 - p_w) \\cdot r + p_w \\cdot -r \\\\\n\t&amp;= p_l \\cdot r + (1 - p_l) \\cdot -r \\\\\n\t&amp;= 2r \\cdot p_l - r\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nwhere $p_w$ is the probability agent $A$ wins and $p_l$ is just the probability agent $A$ loses and agent $B$ wins.\nNotice that these simple utility functions are both positive linear transformations of each agent's win probability $p_w$ and $p_l$ resp. This property makes them both equivalent to using the normalized score (i.e., win probability) in an expectimax search.\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/AI ML/Expectimax Search/","title":"Expectimax Search"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/AI ML/Markov Decision Process (MDP)/":{"body":"markov decision process (MDP)\n\n\\[\n\\renewcommand{\\Pr}[1]{\\text{Pr}\\left[ #1 \\right]}\n\\renewcommand{\\E}[1]{\\mathbb{E}\\left[ #1 \\right]}\n\\renewcommand{\\argmax}{\\text{argmax}}\n\\]\nOverview\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a 4-tuple,  $(S, A, P_a, R_a)$, where:\n\n$S$ is the State space\n$A$ is the Action space (or $A = \\set{ A_s \\;|\\; s \\in S}$, where $A_s$ are the actions available at state $s$)\n$P(s', s, a) = \\Pr{s' \\;|\\; s, a}$ is the transition probability from states $s$ to $s'$ given the agent took action $a$.\n\nThe transition probabilities must be Markovian (i.e., \"memoryless\"); they must not depend on prior states (other than the most recent).\nRecall that we can always engineer \"memorylessness\" into a process by just redefining each new process state as the complete history of states to the given state, though this is often prohibitively expensive.\n\n\n$R(s, s', a)$ is the immediate (or expected immediate) reward when going from states $s$ to $s'$ using action $a$.\n\nWe also have policy functions $\\pi : S \\mapsto A$ which take a state and output which action to take at that state.\nIf we fix a policy function $\\pi$ for a given MDP, we actually get a standard markov chain (since there's no more pesky non-linear max in there). This markov chain has state transition probabilities\n\\[\n\\Pr{s_{t+1} = s' \\;|\\; s_t = s} = P(s', s, \\pi(s))\n\\]\nOur objective for an MDP is to find an optimal policy $\\pi^*$ that maximizes the expected (discounted) sum of rewards\n\\[\n\\E{\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t \\cdot R(s_t,\\, s_{t+1},\\, \\pi^*(s_t))}\n\\]\nwhere $0 \\le \\gamma \\le 1$ is a discounting factor.\nThe hyperparameter $\\gamma$ is a quantity we control. It reflects how much we value short-term rewards over long-term rewards. $\\gamma$ values closer to zero are miopic (prioritize short-term rewards). $\\gamma$ values closer to one produce more optimal policies, but may prevent our learning algorithm from converging within a reasonable time.\nSimulator models\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nLearning the optimal policy $\\pi^*$ means first choosing an algorithm appropriate for our process. Different algorithms require different assumptions about the process and require varying levels of simulator model fidelity.\nHere are three popular algorithms in decreasing order of required simulator model fidelity:\n\nDynamic Programming (e.g. Value Iteration): requires an explicit model of the MDP. This explicit model contains the complete transition probability function and reward function. For certain games, the transition and reward functions could be discrete and infinitely large, ruling out this approach.\nMCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search): requires a generative model, which means you can generate samples of the next state and reward given a prior state and action. If you can efficiently simulate a single turn of your game without knowing the complete dynamics, MCTS may be an option.\nReinforcement Learning (RL): only requires an episodic simulator. In this case, all we need are samples of full episodes (e.g. full game rollouts like $[(s_0, a_0, r_0),\\; (s_1, a_1, r_1,\\; \\ldots,\\; (s_k, a_k, r_k))]$). For instance, AlphaStar (which uses RL) trains on full Starcraft replays as opposed to extracting the core game logic to simulate single game ticks in isolation.\n\nAlgorithms\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nPreliminaries\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nBefore we dive into the algorithms, let's first take a look at some different ways we can express the value of states and q-states under the optimal policy $\\pi^*$:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\tQ^*(s, a)\n\t&amp;= \\sum_{s'} P(s', s, a) \\cdot (R(s', s, a) + \\gamma \\cdot V^*(s')) &amp; \\text{(1.)} \\\\\n\t&amp;= \\sum_{s'} P(s', s, a) \\cdot (R(s', s, a) + \\gamma \\cdot \\max_{a' \\in A_{s'}} Q^*(s', a')) &amp; \\text{(2.)} \\\\\n\t\\\\\n\tV^*(s)\n\t&amp;= \\max_{a \\in A_s} Q^*(s, a) \\\\\n\t&amp;= \\max_a \\sum_{s'} P(s', s, a) \\cdot (R(s', s, a) + \\gamma \\cdot V^*(s')) &amp; \\text{(3.)} \\\\\n\t\\\\\n\tV^\\pi(s)\n\t&amp;= Q^\\pi(s, \\pi(s)) \\\\\n\t&amp;= \\sum_{s'} P(s', s, \\pi(s)) \\cdot (R(s', s, \\pi(s)) + \\gamma \\cdot V^*(s')) &amp; \\text{(4.)} \\\\\n\t\\\\\n\t\\pi(s)\n\t&amp;= \\underset{a \\in A_s}{\\argmax} \\; Q^\\pi(s, a) &amp; \\text{(5.)} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nThis is the standard Q-state value formulation under the optimal policy (also called a Q-value).\nThe Q-values expressed only in terms of other Q-values. Used in Q-value iteration.\nThe state value under the optimal policy expressed in terms of other state values. Used in value iteration.\nThe state value given an explicit policy. Used in policy iteration.\nThe policy update equation. For each state, look at all the actions, evaluate them based on the previous policy, then set the new policy action to the best action. Used in policy iteration.\n\nDynamic Programming\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nValue Iteration\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nValue iteration (as the name implies) iteratively improves our estimate of the optimal state values $V^*$ until convergence.\nWe start with an initial estimate $V_0$ of all the state values. We then iterate from $k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots$, updating our next estimate of the state values $V_{k+1}$ from the current estimate $V_k$. For each iteration, we loop through all the possible states $s \\in S$ and update $V_{k+1}(s)$ like so\n\\[\nV_{k+1}(s) \\gets \\max_a \\sum_{s'} P(s', s, a) \\cdot (R(s', s, a) + \\gamma \\cdot V_k(s'))\n\\]\nNotice that we're not learning an explicit policy function $\\pi$ here. Instead, the policy is implicit in the $\\max$. If we want to recover an explicit policy function for our current estimate, $\\pi_{k+1}(s)$, we simply look at all actions $a$ from state $s$ and choose the one with the greatest expected reward\n\\[\n\\pi_{k+1}(s) = \\underset{a}{\\argmax} \\sum_{s'} P(s', s, a) \\cdot (R(s', s, a) + \\gamma \\cdot V_k(s'))\n\\]\nThere are some proofs that this converges, so long as certain properties are true. For our purposes, we just care about the required properties:\n\nIf the game is finite, then value iteration always converges regardless of $\\gamma$.\nIf the game is infinite but has absorbing states that are reached w.p. 1 as $k \\rightarrow \\infty$ then value iteration converges regardless of $\\gamma$.\nOtherwise, for an infinite game, without absorbing states, we need a discounting value $0 \\le \\gamma &lt; 1$ and a bounded maximum state transition reward $R_\\text{max}$. You can see that with $\\gamma &lt; 1$ and a bounded reward, the maximum possible reward sum is bounded by\n\n\\[\nR(s_1, s_0, a) + \\gamma \\cdot R(s_2, s_1, a) + \\gamma^2 \\cdot R(s_3, s_2, a) + \\cdots \\le \\sum_{t = 0}^\\infty \\gamma^t \\cdot R_\\text{max} = \\frac{1}{1 - \\gamma} \\cdot R_\\text{max}\n\\]\nQ-value Iteration\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWe can also do value iteration, but store Q-values instead of state-values. For some games, the space of Q-states $(s, a)$ (action $a$ applied to state $s$) might be significantly smaller than the original state space.\nIn these cases, we use Q-value Iteration over Value Iteration. The Q-value Iteration update equation looks nearly identical, except we just swap the order of the mean and max\n\\[\nQ_{k+1}(s, a) = \\sum_{s'} P(s', s, a) \\cdot (R(s', s, a) + \\gamma \\cdot \\max_{a'} Q_{k}(s', a')\n\\]\nFinally, our recovered policy\n\\[\n\\pi_{k+1}(s) = \\underset{a}{\\argmax} \\; Q_{k}(s, a)\n\\]\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/AI ML/Markov Decision Process (MDP)/","title":"Markov Decision Process (MDP)"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/WSL/":{"body":"","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/WSL/","title":"WSL"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/WSL/WSL2 custom kernel/":{"body":"WSL2 custom kernel\n\nWhy\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nI want to run perf inside WSL.

Probably target Play or Website.\nIt looks like Flipper refers to https://fbflipper.com/ which is some nice app UI/UX debug/development thing. IDK how to use it yet tho.\nDuring development, we probably target Staging so don't accidentally fuck up Signal's prod services.

There appear to be several different possible interfaces, depending on how the chain listening is setup, like whether we're connected to a full node or light node, or if we have some block filtering etc...\nThe two I can see right off the bat are the traits chain::Listen (whole new blocks) and chain::Confirm (only specific txs we're interested in, only block headers).\nYou choose chain::Listen if you're connected to a full node and chain::Confirm if you're connected to a light node (my speculation).\nThese interfaces are impl'd by ChannelManager, who will eventually call ChannelManager::do_chain_event with a callback, which can possibly generate a FundingLocked msg for sending to the other peer.\nEach channel handles the tx confirm update in Channel::transactions_confirmed. Check if the tx is relevant and sufficiently confirmed, then generate the FundingLocked msg in Channel::check_get_funding_locked.\nIf the Channel::is_usable (both sides confirmed), then also Channel::get_announcement_sigs, which generates a msgs::AccountmentSignatures for sending, announcing the new channel.\nOnce the channel is_usable, we enter Normal Channel Operation.\nOn remote funding_locked msg rx\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nRx peer's funding_locked msg: ChannelManager::internal_funding_locked\nUpdate the channel state w/ Channel::funding_locked.\nLike before, if the channel is now usable (both sides confirmed), is configured for announcement, and is announcable, then generate, sign, and send the msg::AnnouncementSignatures.\n(not clear to me yet when these are announced)\nOnce the channel is_usable, we enter Normal Channel Operation.\nCooperative Channel Close\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nBoth nodes can agree to graceful close a channel. This process consumes less fees and lets both sides access their funds immediately.\nThe other alternatives are unilateral close (maybe someone crashed) and revoked transaction close (the counterparty deliberately cheats and broadcasts an old state).\nOne side begins active shutdown of the channel and indicates how/where they want to be paid. The passive shutdown side responds similarly. Once a side has observed a shutdown, they will no longer accept new HTLCs on this channel. Once the shutdown is begun, both sides will wait for all pending HTLCs to resolve pending HTLCs to fail backwards. Once all HTLCs have resolved, both sides negotiate a final fee amount and broadcast the channel closure tx.\nProtocol Diagram\n+-------+                              +-------+\n|       |--(1)-----  shutdown  -------&gt;|       |\n|       |&lt;-(2)-----  shutdown  --------|       |\n|       |                              |       |\n|       | &lt;complete all pending HTLCs&gt; |       |\n|   A   |                 ...          |   B   |\n|       |                              |       |\n|       |--(3)-- closing_signed  F1---&gt;|       |\n|       |&lt;-(4)-- closing_signed  F2----|       |\n|       |              ...             |       |\n|       |--(?)-- closing_signed  Fn---&gt;|       |\n|       |&lt;-(?)-- closing_signed  Fn----|       |\n+-------+                              +-------+\n\ndef: shutdown wire message\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSee: https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning/blob/711bcefbcc0999543d9622c030ff7dc8118fc26f/lightning/src/ln/msgs.rs#L256\n/// A shutdown message to be sent or received from a peer\npub struct Shutdown {\n\t/// The channel ID\n\tpub channel_id: [u8; 32],\n\t/// The destination of this peer's funds on closing.\n\t/// Must be in one of these forms: p2pkh, p2sh, p2wpkh, p2wsh.\n\tpub scriptpubkey: Script,\n}\n\nactive closer\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nChannelManager::close_channel which immediately calls ChannelManager::close_channel_internal. chanmgr grabs the channel, moves it into shutdown mode, maybe updates monitor w/ new shutdown script, sends shutdown msg to peer.

The public partial payment hash h_i = H(r_i).\nAlice then initiates each partial payment by constructing a route to the destination with value v_i and payment hash h_i. Alice also includes some info (ID, n, s_i) to identify the overall AMP and this partial payment's additive share.\nFinally, when Bob receives all n payments, he can reconstruct BP = s_1 ^ .. ^ s_n. With BP, Bob can then reconstruct each partial payment preimage, which competes the total payment.\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/btc-ln/atomic multipath payments (AMP)/","title":"atomic multipath payments (AMP)"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/btc-ln/breez lightning service providers/":{"body":"breez lightning service providers\n\nSource: https://medium.com/breez-technology/introducing-lightning-service-providers-fe9fb1665d5f\nRequirements for mainstream\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nminimize onboarding friction\n\nfriend asks \"do you accept lightning?\": 1st time inbound receive\n\nIDEAL USE CASE FOR LSPs IMO\n\n\nfriend asks \"can you pay me w/ lightning?\": 1st time outbound send\n\nuser onboards initial balance via fiat onramp\n\nI suppose user can just pay LSP directly huh!\n\n\nuser already has BTC in some wallet/exchange (low probability)\n\n\n\n\nhide complexity from user\n\nusers should not have to understand channels, channel management, HTLCs, etc...\nzero configuration\nonly a single balance (should be no BTC vs LN balance distinction)\n\nSee (https://blockonomi.com/submarine-swaps/)\n\n\nauto-rebalance channels in the background\n\nA user might have capacity spread across multiple channels (is there some way to just merge them all as more capacity is added?)\nEach channel might only have 20% of the total outbound capacity; we need to rebalance if the user wants to make a payment &gt; 20% of their total capacity.

For example, [a, a, b, b, b, c] is a multiset in a flattened, array-like representation. We could just as easily write it in a compact, map-like representation: { a: 2, b: 3, c: 1 }. Here, we take each unique element and associate it with its number of occurances in the multiset.\nMultisets are a natural representation for many common objects in combinatorics, and are often used to model rolling multiple dice, counting cards by suite, and so on.\nWhen representing multisets computationally, it's often convenient to represent them as a sorted array. That way, we'll have exactly one canonical representative for each multiset. This trick can enable further optimizations for us to exploit.\ndef: k-Combinations of a Multiset\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe k-combinations of a multiset are all k-length combinations drawn from the given multiset. Since these are combinations and not permutations, the order is not important (so the permutations [1, 1, 2, 2] and [1, 2, 1, 2] and [2, 2, 1, 1] and ... are all equivalent).\nThe elements are also drawn without replacement, so an element only appearing twice in the multiset should only ever appear at most twice in any combination.\nTo get a better idea of what we're talking about, suppose we've just rolled 6 dice and they come up as [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3]. How many different ways can we select 4 of the 6 dice to re-roll? As you can probably guess, these are just the 4-combinations of the above multiset.\nListing out the 4-combinations of mset = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3] in lexicographic order:\n[1, 1, 2, 2]\n[1, 1, 2, 3]\n[1, 2, 2, 2]\n[1, 2, 2, 3]\n[2, 2, 2, 3]\n\nInsight\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIf you stare at the list above for a bit, you might notice something interesting. If we list out the combinations in sorted order, the first combination is always mset[0..k] and  the last combination is always mset[n-k..n], where mset the multiset, k is the length of each combination, n is the number of elements in the multiset mset, and a..b is Rust range syntax for integers between a (inclusive) and b (exclusive).\nThis property will come in handy in a moment when we write an algorithm to generate the k-combinations, since these two k-combinations give us our start and end points. In other words, we'll start generating combinations from mset[0..k] and we'll know we've finished when the current combination equals mset[n-k..n]\nI'll leave the general proof as an exercise for the reader : )\nAlgorithm\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSee also: http://www.martinbroadhurst.com/combinations-of-a-multiset.html\nHere is the core function, which takes mset, a sorted multiset slice, and arr the previous generated combination.

This Iterator has a nice advantage in that it only uses constant space while iterating, so no need for a big temporary array.\nstruct KCombsIter&lt;T&gt; {\n    mset: Vec&lt;T&gt;,\n    comb: Vec&lt;T&gt;,\n    done: bool,\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; KCombsIter&lt;T&gt;\nwhere\n    T: Clone + PartialOrd + Ord,\n{\n    fn new(mset: Vec&lt;T&gt;, k: usize) -&gt; Self {\n        assert!(k &lt;= mset.len());\n        assert!(is_sorted(mset.iter()));\n\n        let comb = mset[0..k].to_vec();\n\n        Self {\n            mset,\n            comb,\n            done: false,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimpl&lt;T&gt; Iterator for KCombsIter&lt;T&gt;\nwhere\n    T: Clone + PartialOrd + Ord,\n{\n    type Item = Vec&lt;T&gt;;\n\n    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {\n        if !self.done {\n            let comb = self.comb.clone();\n            self.done = next_mset_comb(&amp;self.mset, &amp;mut self.comb);\n            Some(comb)\n        } else {\n            None\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nSee the complete code in action on the Rust Playground: https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=6d08a5fa898eb5e43f9a0f7d30fdd0ad\nThe above may be slightly wasteful for certain usecases, since it needs to allocate on each iteration. For your specific usage, you'll want to specialize the representation of the multiset itself in order to squeeze out every last drop of perf.\nFor example, in my Kingdome Come: Deliverance - Optimal Dice Strategy algorithm, you can see the bit-packed DiceVec, which represents a roll of 0 to 6 dice packed into a single u64 and the likewise specialized iterator DiceVecMultisetsIter, which uses SIMD to manipulate the multisets and doesn't need any intermediate allocation.\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/combinatorics/k-combinations of a multiset/","title":"k-combinations of a multiset"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/confidential computing/":{"body":"","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/confidential computing/","title":"confidential computing"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/confidential computing/enarx (WASM TEE)/":{"body":"enarx (WASM TEE)\n\nsite: https://enarx.dev\nTEE\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs) allow organizations to run applications within a set of memory pages that are encrypted with a secret key by the host CPU in such a way that these pages are not accessible to the operating system or any other software, even running at the highest privilege level.\nThere are currently two leading models of TEEs:\n\nProcess-based: current implementations include Intel’s SGX (Software Guard eXtensions).\nVM-based: current implementations include AMD’s SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization).\n\nApplications that need to run in a TEE must be developed specifically for each platform, and they differ significantly depending if it’s a process-based or VM-based TEE model. Additionally, they must implement something called attestation, which is a validation process for the TEE to prove that it’s genuine before it can be trusted by the application. Rewriting the application or the custom VMM that runs it, as well as the attestation, for each hardware platform is extremely complex and time-consuming.\nIn the next section, we will introduce Enarx, an open source framework for running applications in TEEs that addresses many of the issues raised. We’ll give a simplified overview of the component architecture of Enarx (and how it allows for support for multiple hardware platforms) and the process of creating and deploying applications to TEE instances using Enarx.\n\nEnarx\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nEnarx is a framework for running applications in TEE instances – which we refer to as “Keeps”–without the need to trust lots of dependencies, without the need to rewrite the application, and without the need to implement attestation separately.\nEnarx aims to minimize the trust relationships required when executing applications, meaning that the only components which need to be trusted are: the CPU and associated firmware, the workload itself, and the Enarx middleware, which is fully open source and auditable. Applications run without any of the layers in the stack (e.g. hypervisor, kernel, user-space) being able to look into or alter the Keep or its contents.\nIt provides a WebAssembly runtime, based on wasmtime, offering developers a wide range of language choices for implementation, including Rust, C, C++, C#, Go, Java, Python and Haskell. It is designed to work across silicon architectures transparently to the user so that the application can run equally simple on Intel platforms (SGX or the recently-announced TDX), AMD platforms (SEV) or forthcoming platforms such as Arms’ Realms and IBM’s PEF - all without having to recompile the application code.\nEnarx is CPU-architecture independent, enabling the same application code to be deployed across multiple targets, abstracting issues such as cross-compilation and differing attestation mechanisms between hardware vendors.\nEnarx provides attestation, packaging and provisioning of the application to take place in a way which is transparent to the user. Every instance of an application goes through three steps:\n\nAttestation: Enarx checks that the host to which you’re planning to deploy is a genuine TEE instance.\nPackaging: Once the attestation is complete and the TEE instance verified, the Enarx management component encrypts the application and any required data.\nProvisioning: Enarx then sends the application and data along to the host for execution in the Enarx Keep.\n\nAt no point is the host system able to look inside or change the code or data within a Keep. Thus, Enarx allows organizations with sensitive code or data to run their applications with strong integrity and confidentiality protections.\n\nComponents\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nThreat Model\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nEnarx provides four layers in the run-time stack. Working from the lowest up, they are:\n\na VMM (Virtual Memory Manager)\na microkernel (μkernel)\na WASM runtime (WebAssembly)\na WASI implementation (WebAssembly System Interface).\n\n\nAttestation\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nAn application which is going to run in an Enarx Keep needs to attest two things:\n\nThe hardware TEE providing Keeps.\nA measurement of the Enarx runtime. This means that Red Hat may need to launch a service to abstract attestation. The way that this works is that the client requests attestation from Enarx. Enarx supplies a blob. The client forwards this to Red Hat. Red Hat will then complete attestation of the h/w environment and translate the measurements of Enarx into a something which allows you to identify the specific version of Enarx.\n\n(??? what is Red Hat in this case? the abstract cloud provider? is \"requests from Enarx\" like request from a local library, or actually hitting an API??)\nFrom the client’s point of view, the attestation steps of Enarx end up with the following two cryptographically validated assertions:\n\nThe TEE type and version;\nThe Enarx version and integrity. The attestation processes associated with the various hardware architectures are very different (see SEV architectural and SGX architectural): providing a common mechanism to abstract this is expected to be a major part of the work associated with this project.\n\n\nAMD SEV Remote Attestation Protocol\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nGoal\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThis protocol allows a tenant to:\n\nVerify the platform certificate chain belonging to the remote host where the Enarx Keep is constructed\nEstablish a secure channel with the remote CPU AMD Secure Processor (AMD SP) on the remote host\nCompare its own measurement of the guest's initial state with the AMD SP's measurement from the untrusted host\nSafely deliver its workload to the AMD SP\n\nThis protocol maps the regular SEV launch procedure onto a simple client-server model (client sends request to server; server sends its response to client). In fact, the message formats are comprised of data structures defined in the AMD SEV specification.\nIt is a short, serialized exchange. More importantly, however, it is meant to be an “atomic” transaction. What this means is that the client and the backend complete attestation successfully in this exchange or they don’t. There are no “in-between” end conditions. Therefore, neither party should have any expectation of “retrying” a previous step. It is always forward progress or none at all. As the orchestrator, it is the Keep Manager’s responsibility to know if the keep becomes defunct during attestation, launch, or normal operation. It is expected that the Keep Manager will inform the client of an appropriate error condition and tear down the defunct Keep if necessary.\nMessage Formats\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe data structures defined in the SEV specification form the substrate for this protocol. As a result, message payloads are binary structures. The messages for this protocol are CBOR-encoded. They will be represented here in Concise Data Definition Language (CDDL).\nmessage = {\n      certificate-chain-naples //\n      certificate-chain-rome //\n      launch-start //\n      measurement //\n      secret //\n      finish\n}\n\ncertificate-chain-naples = (\n      \"ark\": certificate-ca-small,\n      \"ask\": certificate-ca-small,\n      \"pdh\": certificate-sev,\n      \"pek\": certificate-sev,\n      \"oca\": certificate-sev,\n      \"cek\": certificate-sev,\n)\n\ncertificate-chain-rome = (\n      \"ark\": certificate-ca-large,\n      \"ask\": certificate-ca-large,\n      \"pdh\": certificate-sev,\n      \"pek\": certificate-sev,\n      \"oca\": certificate-sev,\n      \"cek\": certificate-sev,\n)\n\nlaunch-start = (\n      \"policy\": policy,\n      \"pdh\": certificate-sev,\n      \"session\": session,\n)\n\nmeasurement = (\n      \"build\": build,\n      \"measurement\": bytes .size 32,\n      \"nonce\": bytes .size 16,\n)\n\nsecret = (\n      \"header\": {\n            \"iv\": bytes .size 16,\n            \"mac\": bytes .size 32,\n      },\n      \"ciphertext\": bytes,\n)\n\nfinish = /* TODO */\n\nversion = (\n      \"major\": uint .size 1,\n      \"minor\": uint .size 1,\n)\n\nbuild = (\n      \"version\": version,\n      \"build\": uint .size 1,\n)\n\npolicy = (\n      \"flags\": uint .size 2,\n      \"minfw\": version,\n)\n\nsession = (\n      \"nonce\": bytes .size 16,\n      \"wrap_tk\": bytes .size 32,\n      \"wrap_iv\": bytes .size 16,\n      \"wrap_mac\": bytes .size 32,\n      \"policy_mac\": bytes .size 32,\n)\n\nSequence Diagram\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nSyscall Proxy\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEnarx needs to support Keeps that are built on encrypted virtual machine technologies such as AMD SEV and IBM Power PEF. This means that we need to boot an operating system inside the guest VM. However, existing operating systems do not meet the Enarx design principles (especially: minimal trusted computing base [TCB], external network stack and memory safety). Therefore, this page outlines a plan for building a minimal OS which intends to service only the minimal requirements to run Enarx.\nExisting Systems\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA traditional virtualization stack (such as Qemu + Linux) is typically composed of four components:\n\nThe Virtual Machine Manager (e.g. Qemu)\nThe VM BIOS / Firmware (e.g. OVMF)\nThe Guest Bootloader\nThe Guest Kernel\n\nThe Plan\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIn order to remove these problems, Enarx plans to produce three components when running in a VM-based TEE:\n\nThe Enarx VMM\nThe Enarx μKernel\nThe Enarx Userspace WASM / WASI Runtime\n\nThese three components will be tightly coupled and shipped as an integrated system. The interfaces between the components will be considered an internal implementation detail that can be changed at any time. Enarx tenants will validate the cryptographic measurement of the three components (VMM Guest Memory Setup, μKernel and Userspace Runtime) as a single unit to reduce combinatorial complexity.\n\nIn order to keep the TCB small, especially the exclusion of a full network stack, we intend to proxy syscalls to the host. This allows us to use as many of the host resources as possible while maintaining a small Keep size. It also allows for performance optimizations as Enarx gets more mature. The above chart shows a full trace of a single syscall across the various components. This works as follows:\n\n\nAn Enarx application, compiled to WebAssembly, makes a WASI call, for example: read(). This causes a transition from the JIT-compiled code into our guest userspace Rust code. This does not entail a full context switch and should be fast.\n\n\nThe hand-crafted Rust code should translate the WASI call into a Linux read() syscall. From here we leave Ring 3 (on x86; other architectures have similar structures) and jump into the μKernel, performing a context switch. At this point, some syscalls will be handled internally by the μKernel, for example, memory allocation where the virtual machine has sufficiently allocated pages to handle the request immediately.\n\n\nAll syscalls which cannot be handled internally by the μKernel must be passed to the host, so the guest μKernel passes the syscall request to the host (Linux) kernel. As an optimization, some syscalls may be handled by the host (Linux) kernel directly. For example, read() of a socket can be handled immediately by the host kernel, avoiding future context switches. This requires the (future) development of a Linux kernel module to handle these request directly in the host kernel. Since this is an optimization step, we can wait until the interfaces have settled before pursuing this.\n\n\nAll syscalls which cannot be handled internally by the host kernel must cause a vmexit in the host VMM. For example, a request for additional pages to be mapped into the guest must be passed to the VMM since that is the component which manages the allocated pages. Like previous layers, any syscalls which can be handled directly in the VMM (for example allocation from a pre-allocated memory pool) should be handled immediately to avoid future context switches.\n\n\nIn some cases, the VMM will have to re-enter the host kernel in order to fulfil the request. This is the slowest performance path and should be avoided wherever possible.\n\n\nSyscall Categories and their Layers\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\n\nMemory Allocation: Memory allocation syscalls should be served by the μKernel from pre-allocated pools of huge pages. Allocation of huge pages should be passed through to the host layers.\n\n\nNetworking: All networking syscalls should be passed to the host layers. This ensures that the network stack lives outside the TCB.\n\n\nFilesystem: The guest μKernel should implement a filesystem on top of block encryption and authentication. Block IO should be passed to the host layers. It may even be possible to implement this functionality directly in userspace to reduce the number of context switches. Block authentication, block encryption and the filesystem should be implemented as reusable crates for use in other (non-VM-based keep) contexts.\n\n\nThreading: Techniques like NUMA are extremely hard to implement. Therefore, the μKernel should pass this to the host layers where possible. One particular strategy to accomplish this is to perform vCPU hotplug. When a new thread is created in the guest userspace, a new vCPU is created by the VMM. Therefore there is always a 1:1 mapping between userspace threads and vCPUs. The guest μKernel can pool pre-allocated vCPUs to increase performance.\n\n\nFAQ\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWhy not do containers?\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWould it be possible to implement containers within TEEs? That depends somewhat on the TEE implementation, but the answer is a \"kind of yes\". However, when you run containers on a host, the interactions that the container runtime has with the host leak all sorts of information that we really don't want to be making available to it. One of the design goals of Enarx is to reduce the number of layers that you need to trust, so this isn't a great fit. We know that containers are great, and one of the interesting sets of questions around Enarx revolves around exactly how you orchestrate Keeps, but whatever that looks like, we won't be doing something which meets the specification for containers, for the reasons outlined above.\n(wish they were a bit more specific about this)\nWill Enarx offer protection against side-channel attacks?\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe short answer is yes, where possible. To expand on this, first of all this is only a goal for now, as we won't be focusing our efforts on it immediately given we are still working on core functionality. Secondly, it is likely to be impossible to mitigate all side-channel attacks, but we certainly will attempt to do so where possible, as part of our aim to make Enarx Keeps as secure as possible.\nTEE vs TPM\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nYou could implement many of the capabilities of a TPM within a TEE, but it doesn't make sense to create a \"full\" TPM implementation within a TEE on two levels:\n\nOne of the key points of a TPM is that it's linked to the hardware, meaning that the boot sequence can be tied into PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers). TEEs aren't necessarily suitable as Hardware-Based Roots of Trust.\nEnarx provides a general processing environment. The capabilities of a TPM are carefully scoped, and to meet the requirements of the TCG (Trusted Computing Group, the standards body for TPMs), you need to implement these very carefully.\n\nTEE vs HSM\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nHSM's provide higher levels of protection than TEEs, but are separate modules, accessed via PCI bus, network, etc. TEEs are integral to the CPU packages on a motherboard. Both HSMs and TEE instances can be used as general-function processing units (depending on the model), and both can be programmed for particular uses (e.g. PKCS#11 modules). The cost of HSMs is high (typically thousands of dollars), whereas TEEs are integral to a chipset.

In my experience, it's a bit like wading through \"acronym soup\", desperately searching for familiar ground to find your footing before you can truly begin learning.\nTo make this process easier for newcomers, I've written an extended glossary of SGX terminology, with extensive links and explanations.\nMost of the code links and samples are written in Rust.\nThe entries are not listed in any particular order.\n\nQuote\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA datastructure provided as proof to an external party that an application enclave is running on genuine Intel hardware at a given TCB version.\nAn application's identity Report, signed by an Attestation Key (AK) (usually the one provisioned in the Quoting Enclave (QE)).\nReport (EREPORT)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA hardware report generated by an enclave containing (1) the enclave's identity, (2) measurement info, and (3) a small amount of application data (64-bytes), called the ReportData.\nReports are efficiently verifiable inside other enclaves on the same machine. When generated via the EREPORT instruction, the Report struct will contain a MAC created from a special Seal Key used for tagging reports. This allows us to cheaply verify reports without an expensive signature verification, since other enclaves can just rederive the report key and check the MAC tag, which is fast.\nOtherwise for remote attestation:\nAttestation Key (AK)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe key used by the QE to sign application enclave REPORTs, producing Quotes.\nThis Quote certifies that an application enclave is running on genuine Intel SGX HW at a given TCB version.\nThe AK is created and owned by the owner of the remote attestation infrastructure (e.g., Azure or Intel) but is also certified by the Intel SGX rooted key (this key is rooted to the platform HW fuses), which proves the enclave is valid.\nArchitectural Enclaves\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIntel provides several Intel-signed enclaves necessary for running user application enclaves, verifying launch policies, producing remote attestation Quotes, and more.\nA non-exhaustive list of Architectural Enclaves:\n\nLaunch Enclave (LE)\nQuoting Enclave (QE)\nProvisioning Certification Enclave (PCE)\nProvisioning Enclave (PE)\nPlatform Services Enclave (PSE)\n\nTo see the complete list of signed enclaves:\n# Valid for Intel SGX v2.21 and Intel DCAP v1.18\n\n$ cd $(mktemp -d)\n$ curl https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.21/prebuilt_ae_2.21.tar.gz | tar -xzv\n$ curl https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-dcap/1.18/linux/prebuilt_dcap_1.18.tar.gz | tar -xzv\n\n$ cd psw/ae/data/prebuilt/\n$ exa -1\nle_prod_css.bin\nlibsgx_id_enclave.signed.so\nlibsgx_le.signed.so\nlibsgx_pce.signed.so\nlibsgx_pve.signed.so\nlibsgx_qe.signed.so\nlibsgx_qe3.signed.so\nlibsgx_qve.signed.so\nlibsgx_tdqe.signed.so\n\nLaunch Enclave (LE)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe Launch Enclave generates a Launch Token, which is needed to run another enclave.

A malicious cloud operator (Azure) could DoS attack us by changing the Owner Epoch, forcing us to re-provision all enclave secrets.\nMore likely, a vulnerability, TCB violation, or operator error could lead to an unintended Owner Epoch rotation.\nTo help with recovery, applications should record the current Owner Epoch in case something goes wrong. If nobody remembers the Owner Epoch, we can never restore our Seal Keys.\nApparently it's also possible virtualize the Owner Epoch if running inside a hypervisor?

An enclave measurement effectively summarizes the initial state of the trusted software running in the enclave.\nIntel SGX constructs this measurement when the enclave is built and initialized. During enclave init, it records a log of all important build activities, including:\n\nContent: code, data, stack, heap\nLocation of each page within the enclave\nSecurity flags used\n\nThe measurement is actually not the full log, but a 256-bit hash digest of the log. This measurement is stored as MRENCLAVE inside the enclave's software TCB and is accessible inside the enclave via a syscall.\nClients can then compare the observed MRENCLAVE with a trusted, expected MRENCLAVE value to guarantee that the enclave is running the expected software.\nFor systems using the Fortanix SGX Stream format (SGXS) to describe an enclave, the SHA256 hash of the .sgxs bytes is exactly the enclave's MRENCLAVE*. Very convenient!\n*Unless you use the Extended SGXS format, which allows unmeasured sections. In that case, you need to be a little more careful about how you hash the format and ignore the unmeasured sections.\nWhy do we need to verify the software inside the enclave?\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIf the client forgets to verify the actual software running inside the enclave, there's a simple attack to exfiltrate the client's secrets! All we need to do is run some malicious code in the enclave, which just prints the client's secrets after provisioning. Boom, client secrets leaked.\nKeep in mind the enclave could be 100% genuine Intel hardware, but unless the client verifies the actual software inside the enclave, they should absolutely not provision their secrets.\nFortanix SGX Stream format (SGXS)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe SGX stream (SGXS) format is the most basic description of an enclave, and when combined with a signature and initialization token file contains all the information needed by an Operating System to load the enclave.\nThe format consists entirely of all data that would be hashed to produce the enclave measurement [[#Enclave Measurement MRENCLAVE|MRENCLAVE]].\nSee: Fortanix EDP - SGX Stream format (SGXS).\nSee: Fortanix EDP - ftxsgx-elf2sgxs for converting a standard ELF binary to SGXS.\nSee: Fortanix EDP - sgxs-sign for signing SGXS with your RSA private key.\nSigner Measurement (MRSIGNER)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEach enclave is also signed by the client or the enclave author, depending on the exact trust model. The MRSIGNER is just the enclave signer's pubkey hash.\nThe signer signs part of the SIGSTRUCT, which then includes the signature and signer pubkey inside.\nSealing keys can be derived from the signer measurement + ISV product id/svn, instead of the enclave measurement to allow easy upgrading across different versions of the same enclave.\nRust code for generating a signer and computing its measurement:\n// Generating a 3072-bit RSA key + measurement for signing\n// sigstructs.

This token is called the EINITTOKEN and is generated by the Launch Enclave after it verifies the full Enclave Signature Struct SIGSTRUCT signature.\nThe SGX platform then verifies the contents of the token before it allows the enclave to initialize.\nWhy does Intel use this EINITTOKEN thing rather than just passing the full SIGSTRUCT each time we init? My guess is that it allows us to amortize the SIGSTRUCT signature verification cost. The LE do the expensive signature verification once, produce a cheaply verifiable launch token, then use the launch token each time rather than the expensive SIGSTRUCT.\nNote that the token is only verifiable by other enclaves on the same machine; it just contains a MAC created with a privileged Intel-only Seal Key.\nstruct Einittoken {\n    valid: u32,\n    _reserved1: [u8; 44],\n    attributes: Attributes,\n    mrenclave: [u8; 32],\n    _reserved2: [u8; 32],\n    mrsigner: [u8; 32],\n    _reserved3: [u8; 32],\n    cpusvnle: [u8; 16],\n    isvprodidle: u16,\n    isvsvnle: u16,\n    _reserved4: [u8; 24],\n    maskedmiscselectle: Miscselect,\n    maskedattributesle: Attributes,\n    keyid: [u8; 32],\n    mac: [u8; 16],\n}\n\nEnclave Attributes\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nstruct Attributes {\n    flags: AttributesFlags,\n    xfrm: u64,\n}\n\nbitflags! {\n\tstruct AttributesFlags: u64 {\n\t\tconst INIT          = 0b0000_0001;\n\t\tconst DEBUG         = 0b0000_0010;\n\t\tconst MODE64BIT     = 0b0000_0100;\n\t\tconst PROVISIONKEY  = 0b0001_0000;\n\t\tconst EINITTOKENKEY = 0b0010_0000;\n\t\tconst CET           = 0b0100_0000;\n\t\tconst KSS           = 0b1000_0000;\n\t}\n}\n\n// file: common/inc/sgx_attributes.h\n\n/* Enclave Flags Bit Masks */\n#define SGX_FLAGS_INITTED        0x0000000000000001ULL     /* If set, then the enclave is initialized */\n#define SGX_FLAGS_DEBUG          0x0000000000000002ULL     /* If set, then the enclave is debug */\n#define SGX_FLAGS_MODE64BIT      0x0000000000000004ULL     /* If set, then the enclave is 64 bit */\n#define SGX_FLAGS_PROVISION_KEY  0x0000000000000010ULL     /* If set, then the enclave has access to provision key */\n#define SGX_FLAGS_EINITTOKEN_KEY 0x0000000000000020ULL     /* If set, then the enclave has access to EINITTOKEN key */\n#define SGX_FLAGS_KSS            0x0000000000000080ULL     /* If set, then the enclave uses KSS */\n#define SGX_FLAGS_AEX_NOTIFY     0x0000000000000400ULL     /* If set, then the enclave enables AEX Notify */\n\n/* XSAVE Feature Request Mask */\n#define SGX_XFRM_LEGACY          0x0000000000000003ULL     /* Legacy XFRM which includes the basic feature bits required by SGX, x87 state(0x01) and SSE state(0x02) */\n#define SGX_XFRM_AVX             0x0000000000000006ULL     /* AVX XFRM which includes AVX state(0x04) and SSE state(0x02) required by AVX */\n#define SGX_XFRM_AVX512          0x00000000000000E6ULL     /* AVX-512 XFRM */\n#define SGX_XFRM_MPX             0x0000000000000018ULL     /* MPX XFRM - not supported */\n#define SGX_XFRM_PKRU            0x0000000000000200ULL     /* PKRU state */\n#define SGX_XFRM_AMX             0x0000000000060000ULL     /* AMX XFRM, including XTILEDATA(0x40000) and XTILECFG(0x20000) */\n\nMost user enclaves only need to enable the MODE64BIT attribute in production.\nThe KSS attribute enables the Key sharing and separation (KSS) feature.\nThe Extended Features Request Mask (xfrm) allows an enclave to ensure certain CPU features (e.g., SSE, AESNI) are available, or the enclave will fail to load.\nEnclave Miscselect\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\npub struct Miscselect: u32 {\n\tconst EXINFO = 0b0000_0001;\n}\n\nKEYREQUEST\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA struct which gets fed into the Seal Key KDF in order to generate keys for sealing or remote attestation.\nThe keyname is a user-defined label\nstruct Keyrequest {\n    keyname: u16,\n    keypolicy: Keypolicy,\n    isvsvn: u16,\n    _reserved1: u16,\n    cpusvn: [u8; 16],\n    attributemask: [u64; 2],\n    keyid: [u8; 32],\n    miscmask: u32,\n    _reserved2: [u8; 436],\n}\n\nstruct Keypolicy: u16 {\n\tconst MRENCLAVE = 0b0000_0001;\n\tconst MRSIGNER  = 0b0000_0010;\n}\n\n#[repr(u16)]\nenum Keyname {\n    Einittoken    = 0,\n    Provision     = 1,\n    ProvisionSeal = 2,\n    Report        = 3,\n    Seal          = 4,\n}\n\nKey sharing and separation (KSS)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSee: https://www.fortanix.com/blog/2018/02/upcoming-intel-sgx-features-explained#key-sharing-and-separation-kss\nPremise: Communicating between two different enclaves is cumbersome. The KSS feature adds more flexibility.\nThe new KSS feature adds a configuration value+SVN and two extra 16-byte product IDs.\nThe 64-byte configuration value and 2-byte SVN is used as a post-init identity. The value affects the attestation identity and (optionally) seal key derivation, but isn't included in the Sigstruct. This allows a single enclave binary that is specialized into different services (with different identities!) at load time.\nThe extra product IDs are \"family ID\" and \"extra product ID\" (but can be used for other purposes). They can be used in seal key derivation. The IDs are included in the Sigstruct but not the EINITTOKEN. meaning a launch enclave can't use these for access controls.\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/confidential computing/intel SGX/SGX lingo/","title":"SGX lingo"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/confidential computing/intel SGX/overview/":{"body":"intel SGX - overview\n\nWikipedia: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Software_Guard_Extensions\n\nThey allow user-level as well as operating system code to define private regions of memory, called enclaves, whose contents are protected and unable to be either read or saved by any process outside the enclave itself, including processes running at higher privilege levels\n\n\nApplications running inside of SGX must be written to be side channel resistant as SGX does not protect against side channel measurement or observation.\n\n\nEnclaves cannot use sockets because enclaves rely on the untrusted application that loads the enclave to communicate with external components. Enclaves cannot create independent communication channels to outside entities. This would break their security and trust model. source\n\n\n\nEnclave memory cannot be read or written from outside the enclave regardless of the current privilege level and CPU mode.\nProduction enclaves cannot be debugged by software or hardware debuggers.\nThe enclave environment cannot be entered through classic function calls, jumps, register manipulation, or stack manipulation. The only way to call an enclave function is through a new instruction that performs several protection checks.\nEnclave memory is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms with replay protection. Tapping the memory or connecting the DRAM modules to another system will yield only encrypted data.\nThe memory encryption key randomly changes every power cycle. The key is stored within the CPU and is not accessible.\nData isolated within enclaves can only be accessed by code that shares the enclave.\n\n\nSee also SGX 101\n\nWith SGX, your CPU comes with two new 128bit keys: RPK &amp; RSK\nRPK: Root Provisioning Key. Known only to Intel.\nRSK: Root Sealing Key. Most derived keys based on RSK.\nNew DRAM key (derived from RSK?) every power cycle.\nRemote Attestation is enforced for the client to prove to the service provider that an enclave is running a given software, inside a given CPU, with a given security level, for a given Individual Software Vender (ISV). This is required before the service provider decides to provide requested secrets.\nSealed Storage is required to save secret data to untrusted media. Note that data and code inside enclaves are not secrets. They are just logics that are required to process the secret and most of them are open sourced or can be reverse engineered. Therefore, secrets are provisioned later by the service provider and should be stored out of the enclave through sealing mechanism when necessary (e.g. for future usage).\n\nSecurity Limitations\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nCache timing attacks\nPhysical attacks.

E.g. trusted development environment\nCPU bugs and bugs in dependencies.\n\nApplication Design\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nApplication design with Intel SGX requires that the application be divided into two components:\n\n\nTrusted component: This is the enclave. The code that resides in the trusted code is the code that accesses an application’s secrets. An application can have more than one trusted component/enclave.\n\n\nUntrusted component: This is the rest of the application and any of its modules. It is important to note that, from the standpoint of an enclave, the OS and the VMM are considered untrusted components.\n\n\nFairly expensive to communicate back-and-forth (how much?)\n\n\nECalls -&gt; call into enclave\n\n\nOCalls -&gt; call out to untrusted code\n\n\nproxy generation via EDL (enclave description language)\n\n\nspecialized memory allocator. limitations on stack/heap sizes, threads, etc...\n\n\nEnclave runs concurrently with the OS.

The data can be read back in by the enclave at a later date and unsealed (decrypted). The encryption keys are derived internally on demand and are not exposed to the enclave.\nThere are two methods of sealing data:\n\nEnclave Identity: This method produces a key that is unique to this exact enclave.\nSealing Identity: This method produces a key that is based on the identity of the enclave’s Sealing Authority. Multiple enclaves from the same signing authority can derive the same key.\n\nHardware Requirements\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nIntel CPU later than 2015+\n\nPerformance Overhead\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\ncalling some max(&amp;[u32]) function inside enclave.\nsource: https://medium.com/@danny_harnik/impressions-of-intel-sgx-performance-22442093595a\n\nsgx-perf: A Performance Analysis Tool for Intel SGX Enclaves (2018)\n\nWe measured transition times of ≈5,850 cycles (≈2.1 µs) with a warm cache for one round-trip (see §5 for the experimental settings). In the second case, we measured a transition time of ≈10,170 cycles (≈3.8 µs), ≈1.74× more than without patches. Finally, with all the updates and microcodes to address the  Spectre and Foreshadow vulnerabilities enclave transitions became even slower, resulting in a round-trip time of ≈13,100 cycles (≈4.9 µs), ≈ 2.24× more. This further underlines the need to save on enclave transitions.\n\nAbout 20,000 transitions/sec? per thread? overall?\n\nIn-Enclave Synchronisation: Enclaves can be multi-threaded and therefore need synchronisation primitives. Unfortunately, as sleeping is not possible inside enclaves, the in-enclave synchronisation primitives provided by the SGX SDK implement additional ocalls to sleep outside of the enclave.\n\n\nThe SDK offers mutexes that work as follows: if a thread tries to lock an unlocked mutex, then this operation succeeds without needing to leave the enclave. Whenever a thread tries to lock an already locked mutex, it will put itself into a queue and exit the enclave via an ocall to sleep\n\n\nEnclave Paging: Another important factor for enclave performance is enclave size, especially the size of the working set. SGX stores all enclaves inside the EPC which on current implementations has a size of 128 MiB. Of those, 93 MiB are usable.\n\nSGXv1 requires pre-declared limits on stack/heap allocations.\n\nWith SGX v2, this becomes less of a problem, as the enclave can be extended after creation. Therefore, the enclave can be created small and as soon as stack or heap are exhausted, new pages may be added on-demand.\n\n\nEnclave Signing\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nhttps://docs.conclave.net/signing.html\nEnclaves must be signed. With modern SGX servers you may self-sign your enclaves, but, a signature is still required.\nWhy is signing required?\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSigning requirements are a part of the Intel SGX architecture. The enclave signature is used for two different purposes:\n\nLinking different enclave versions together into an upgrade path, so new enclaves can decrypt data stored by or sent to old enclaves.\nAuthorising which enclaves can be executed on a host.\n\nRestricting which enclaves can launch on a host ensures that datacenter providers aren't hosting server processes they can't examine (??????) or turn over to law enforcement. It also makes it harder for people to write malware with un-debuggable cores (loooool), and is part of the privacy (anti-tracking) infrastructure in SGX.\nUsing signatures to link binaries into a single upgrade path is the same technique used by Android and iOS to move permissions and stored data from old to new apps.\nSigning is also used to authorise which enclaves can start. By default Intel chips won't start an enclave unless it's signed by an Intel key, but this behaviour can be changed and on Azure (see \"Deploying to Azure\") enclaves can be self-signed. If you want to use older hardware getting whitelisted by Intel is free and can be done quickly. It's a similar process to getting an SSL certificate but using different tools.\nOn Xeon E CPUs with Intel FLC support in the chipset, and a recent enough kernel driver, the owner can add their own whitelisting authorities via BIOS/UEFI firmware settings. This means they can replace the default \"must be approved by Intel\" launch control logic with their own (which may e.g. only allow their own enclaves, or may allow any self-signed enclave).\nHosted SGX\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nAzure\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nAzure Confidential Compute\nPricing (2022/02/18):\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/\nFilters: US East 2 + grep \"SGX\"\nDCsv2- and DCdsv3-series\nThe DCsv2-series virtual machines can help protect the confidentiality and integrity of your data and code while it’s processed in the public cloud.

These secrets remain encryped and unintelligible to the outside, untrusted service provider, machine, and OS.\n\nRemote attestation procedure in detail\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nAttesting to another local enclave is easy and efficient.\nAttesting to a remote client requires a few extra steps:\n\nThe application enclave generates a Report, which includes the various things we want to attest to, described above.\nAsk the local Quoting Enclave (QE) to sign the application enclave's report with its Attestation Key (AK), usually via the Architectural Enclave Service Manager (AESM) API.\n(Optional) The application enclave can verify that the Quote was generated by a trusted Quoting Enclave (QE) on the local machine.\n\nIn theory, this step is optional, since the remote attestation verifier should ultimately reject an invalid Quote. However this step can give the enclave itself  assurance that it's talking to a legitimate QE.\nWhen requesting a Quote, the application enclave can provide a 16-byte nonce to ensure freshness (preventing replay attacks of old quotes).\nFrom the AESM or Quoting Library, the application enclave should receive a serialized quote and QE Report from their Quote request.\nThis QE Report is a Report generated by the Quoting Enclave. The application enclave should check that the Quoting Enclave ID in the QE Report is trustworthy.\nThe application should then check that the QE Report's ReportData field contains the value SHA-256(nonce || quote) || [0; 32].\nFinally, the application enclave should check that the Quote actually contains its own Report.\n\n\n(EPID-only) This signed report, called a Quote, is sent to the endorsement service Intel Attestation Services (IAS) who will endorse (read: sign with its cert) the report IFF it believes the Quote is valid.\n\nThis endorsed Quote is now verifiable by anyone that knows the endorsement service's root CA cert.\nThe remote Intel-run IAS is the only party that can endorse these EPID Quotes. This makes Intel's service an interactive party in our attestation protocol flow when using EPID Quotes.\n\n\n(ECDSA-only) The report is signed by an ECDSA Attestation Key in a Quoting Enclave. The Attestation Key is endorsed by an Attestation Key Cert from the Provisioning Certification Enclave (PCE).\n\nAttestation Key Algorithms\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThere are a two-ish different Attestation Key (TODO link) algorithms that each have different tradeoffs and TCB surface.\n\nECDSA P256 or ECDSA P384\n\nsimple, but ids are public and linkable. This is not a problem in data centers or confidential computing scenarios.\n\n\nIntel Enhanced Privacy ID (EPID)\n\ncomplicated, but ids are private and revocations are efficient.\nsignificant increased protocol complexity.\nIntel verifier is all attestations.\n\n\n\nSee: sgx_types::sgx_ql_attestation_algorithm_id_t\nRemote Attestation Quote Verification\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nTo help visualize how the chain-of-trust extends from our Trust Root (the Intel SGX Root CA) to the enclave's attested values (usually a TLS cert pubkey), I've made this helpful diagram.\nQuickly recapping, the User starts with three trusted objects:\n\nthe Intel SGX Root CA\nthe acceptable Quoting Enclave identities, retrieved from the IAS (not depicted)\nthe acceptable Application Enclave identities (e.g., MRSIGNER or MRENCLAVE)\n\nThe Application Enclave usually provides the Quote to the User as part of setting up a secure transport channel. The User wants to verify the Quote to ensure the enclave is running the expected software.\nThis particular diagram shows the ECDSA DCAP-QL Quote structure and how each component commits or signs other sub-components. The flow is somewhat different for EPID-based attestation Quotes.\n\nPCK lookup service\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIntel DCAP - Provisioning Certificate Caching Service (PCCS)\nGET platform's Provisioning Certification Key (PCK) certs\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe platform is identified by its encrypted Platform Provisioning ID (PPID) and Provisioning Certification Enclave ID (PCE-ID).\nGET Current Intel Quoting Enclave (QE) and Quote Verification Enclave (QVE) Identities\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nQuery the Intel Trusted Services API for current valid Quoting Enclave (QE) identity.\n$ curl -v -X GET \"https://api.trustedservices.intel.com/sgx/certification/v3/qe/identity\"\n\n{\n  \"enclaveIdentity\": {\n    \"id\": \"QE\",\n    \"version\": 2,\n    \"issueDate\": \"2022-04-12T21:57:18Z\",\n    \"nextUpdate\": \"2022-05-12T21:57:18Z\",\n    \"tcbEvaluationDataNumber\": 12,\n    \"miscselect\": \"00000000\",\n    \"miscselectMask\": \"FFFFFFFF\",\n    \"attributes\": \"11000000000000000000000000000000\",\n    \"attributesMask\": \"FBFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0000000000000000\",\n    \"mrsigner\": \"8C4F5775D796503E96137F77C68A829A0056AC8DED70140B081B094490C57BFF\",\n    \"isvprodid\": 1,\n    \"tcbLevels\": [\n      {\n        \"tcb\": {\n          \"isvsvn\": 6\n        },\n        \"tcbDate\": \"2021-11-10T00:00:00Z\",\n        \"tcbStatus\": \"UpToDate\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"tcb\": {\n          \"isvsvn\": 5\n        },\n        \"tcbDate\": \"2020-11-11T00:00:00Z\",\n        \"tcbStatus\": \"OutOfDate\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"tcb\": {\n          \"isvsvn\": 4\n        },\n        \"tcbDate\": \"2019-11-13T00:00:00Z\",\n        \"tcbStatus\": \"OutOfDate\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"tcb\": {\n          \"isvsvn\": 2\n        },\n        \"tcbDate\": \"2019-05-15T00:00:00Z\",\n        \"tcbStatus\": \"OutOfDate\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"tcb\": {\n          \"isvsvn\": 1\n        },\n        \"tcbDate\": \"2018-08-15T00:00:00Z\",\n        \"tcbStatus\": \"OutOfDate\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  \"signature\": \"1750f7e5997a8cb5ba2073f7a4312e43f5771a409e0610b20428dffebe51e53a6eadfb5691045b0819b29754dd6f5cfd20837b0e6f76e2307146dd3deb5203be\"\n}\n\nLikewise, there's a similar endpoint for looking up the Quote Verification Enclave (QVE) identity:\n$ curl -v -X GET \"https://api.trustedservices.intel.com/sgx/certification/v3/qve/identity\"\n\nFor both responses, the \"signature\" field contains a signature over the \"enclaveIdentity\" body (hex-encoded, no whitespace, very canonical lmao) using the TCB Info Signing Key.\nDetermining if an SGX Enclave identity matches the standard Quoting Enclave Identity\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nRetrieve standard Quoting Enclave Identity from the Intel SGX Provisioning Certification Service (PCS) and verify that it is a valid structure issued by Intel.\nPerform the following comparison of SGX Enclave Report against the retrieved QE Identity:\n\nVerify if MRSIGNER field retrieved from SGX Enclave Report is equal to the value of mrsigner field in QE Identity.\nVerify if ISVPRODID field retrieved from SGX Enclave Report is equal to the value of isvprodid field in QE Identity.\nApply miscselectMask (binary mask) from QE Identity to MISCSELECT field retrieved from SGX Enclave Report.

Sealing provides one piece of the puzzle.\nReal code in oasis-core for sealing\n\nDeriving some Key Material\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWhile an enclave is running, the enclave application code has access to the EGETKEY instruction.

Newer enclave versions can also successfully derive keys created on older versions, but older versions will fail to derive keys created on newer versions. See Preventing Version Downgrade Attacks.\n\nPreventing Version Downgrade Attacks\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nOlder versions of an enclave should not be able to derive keys or read sealed data from a newer enclave version. To prevent these downgrading attacks, the KEYREQUEST also contains the current CPU SVN and ISV SVN. The EGETKEY intrinsic will then verify that the keyrequest  CPU SVN and ISV SVN are not beyond the current CPU SVN and enclave ISV SVN.\nSealing Pattern\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSealed data should effectively include the SGX lingo &gt; KEYREQUEST used to seal the data. When an enclave wants to decrypt some sealed data, it just passes this attached KEYREQUEST to EGETKEY. An enclave should then reseal the data, but with a freshly generated Seal Key. This will ratchet any old secure platform versions forward.\nMigrating data between enclaves\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nSame platform, same enclave, different instances\n\nOffline migration is always possible. Both enclaves will simply rederive the same keys.\n\n\nSame platform, different enclave versions\n\nIf the enclave has a newer security version for the CPU SVN + ISV SVN and the Keypolicy is set to MRSIGNER\n\nThen Offline migration is possible. Both enclaves will derive the same keys.\n\n\nOtherwise, online migration is necessary.\n\n\nDifferent platform, same or different enclave\n\nOnline migration is necessary.\n\n\n\nOffline migration\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWe say offline migration is available when no coordination is required for two enclaves to read each other's sealed data.\nOnline migration\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIn contrast, online migration requires both enclaves to coordinate. Both enclaves usually need to be online and able to communicate. The enclaves then establish a secure channel using remote attestation and migrate secrets or other unsealed data over the secure channel.\nAnother approach is to delegate key distribution to a shared enclave service. This is what oasis does with their oasis &gt; Key Manager Enclaves. Here compute enclaves store their machine-specific keys with the key manager enclaves, along with a policy for which other enclaves can read the keys. This way enclaves don't need to communicate with or attest each other directly and can instead just query the local key manager enclave.\nExamples\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\noasis\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSee: oasis &gt; Sealing\nintel/linux-sgx\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nhttps://github.com/intel/linux-sgx/blob/26c458905b72e66db7ac1feae04b43461ce1b76f/sdk/tseal/tSeal.cpp\nextern \"C\" sgx_status_t sgx_seal_data_ex(\n\tconst uint16_t key_policy,\n\tconst sgx_attributes_t attribute_mask,\n\tconst sgx_misc_select_t misc_mask,\n\tconst uint32_t additional_MACtext_length,\n\tconst uint8_t *p_additional_MACtext,\n\tconst uint32_t text2encrypt_length,\n\tconst uint8_t *p_text2encrypt,\n\tconst uint32_t sealed_data_size,\n\tsgx_sealed_data_t *p_sealed_data\n) {\n    sgx_status_t err = SGX_ERROR_UNEXPECTED;\n    sgx_key_id_t keyID;\n    sgx_key_request_t tmp_key_request;\n    uint8_t payload_iv[SGX_SEAL_IV_SIZE];\n    memset(&amp;payload_iv, 0, sizeof(payload_iv));\n\n\n    uint32_t sealedDataSize = sgx_calc_sealed_data_size(additional_MACtext_length,text2encrypt_length);\n    // Check for overflow\n    if (sealedDataSize == UINT32_MAX)\n    {\n        return SGX_ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER;\n    }\n\n    //\n    // Check parameters\n    //\n    // check key_request-&gt;key_policy:\n    //  1.

Unfortunately, this is more trustworthy but still only provides you with a relative time. We want the absolute time.\n\nWhat do we do about it?\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nRequirements\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nWe want absolute time, so we can communicate with others outside our own machine.\nThe true time, as observed by other enclaves on the machine, should be strictly increasing.\nThe platform operator is outside our TCB. They should not be able to make the true time go backwards.\nWe are not secure against DoS by the platform operator. This doesn't significantly change our threat model however, since they can just turn off the machine. : )\nMinimize the startup latency of other enclaves by doing the bootstrap once in a shared enclave.\n\nApproach\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nShared Time-keeper Enclave\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nUse a shared enclave that keeps track of time on the same machine. Other local enclaves can query the Time-keeper for the current true time.\nThe Time-keeper uses a combination of a remote, semi-trusted time service, and a local, trusted relative clock provided by the Intel ME and Platform Services Enclave (PSE) to keep track of the true time.\n\nThe connection to the remote time service needs to be secure against the platform operator. We probably use NTP with NTS to some small, fixed set of NTP servers (that support NTS).\nOn startup, we use the local insecure time to bootstrap our secure connection to the remote time service.\n\nWe need the initial insecure time measurement so we can complete the TLS handshake.\nWe could also attempt to bootstrap more securely with roughtime.\nSince platform operator DoS is out-of-scope, a bad initial insecure time is effectively the same as a DoS, since we'll just reject the server's TLS cert.\n\n\nWe then use our secure channel to the remote time service to fix our trusted clock base.\nWe then use the local, trusted relative clock to track the time since the clock base.\nSince the relative clock only provides second granularity, we use an intra-epoch counter stored in-memory that gets incremented after each request.\n\nOn startup, we need to make sure we wait until the next second for the previous epoch to fully elapse.\n\n\nDepending on requirements, refresh the base time by re-bootstrapping from the remote time source to reduce clock-skew. This refresh could happen every hour or so.\nOther enclaves can request the current time from the time-keeper. The request should include a nonce for freshness/replay-prevention. The request should be (at least) MAC'd with a shared symmetric key derived via EGETKEY with the same key_id.\n\nLinks\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nRFC 8915 - Network Time Security (NTS) for NTP\nchrony - Notes on using NTS\nNTPsec - NTS Quickstart\nIntel - Trusted Time and Monotonic Counters with SGX Platform Services Enclave\n2019 - Applications and Challenges in Securing Time\nGoogle Roughtime Protocol\nint08h/roughtime - Rust library\nCloudflare - secure time.cloudflare.com announcement\nCloudflare - Announcing cfnts: Cloudflare's implementation of NTS in Rust\ncloudflare/cfnts - supports NTS, looks unmaintained\nvpetrigo/sntpc - plain SNTP\nrisoflora/sntp_request - plain SNTP\nioerror/tlsdate - securely extract time from TLS handshake\ndrand - distributed randomness beacon, emits timestamp+random every 30 sec, signed quorum as one BLS threshold signature\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/confidential computing/intel SGX/secure time/","title":"secure time"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/confidential computing/intel TDX/":{"body":"intel TDX\n\n\nIntel TDX is designed to isolate virtual machines from the VMM/hypervisor and other non-VMM system software on the platform.

The TLS session can be terminated at the service provider edge and existing middleware load balancers and reverse proxies can operate as normal on the unprotected parts of the HTTP request.\n\nInvasiveness\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nDifferent attestation protocols operate at different levels of the transport protocol stack and require varying changes to existing transport protocols. Invasiveness is a qualitative statement about the changes to existing libraries needed before a new client language can be supported.\nAs an upper bound, changing the TCP protocol handshake would be incredibly invasive and would likely require maintaining Linux kernel patches or running a custom user-space TCP stack. Supporting locked down platforms like Android or iOS would be... challenging to say the least.\nIn contrast, a hypothetical lower bound would probably be a default TLS config (i.e., no custom verifiers, no self-signed certs, default global CA set), since that would be supported \"out-of-the-box\" on every major platform.\nTLS Configs by Invasiveness and Availability\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIf you don't control the client libraries connecting to the enclaves, it's important to stay on the TLS happy path. Different platforms and client libraries allow configuring TLS to varying levels. Staying on the happy path is important for ease-of-implementation and time-to-market. TLS configurations in order from most to least easy/available:\n\ndefault configuration (available everywhere)\n\nThis means the enclave needs a cert rooted at a global CA, e.g., Let's Encrypt.\n\n\ncustom root CA cert (available everywhere, slightly more complicated)\n\nThe client pins a specific root CA cert for this connection.\nThe root CA cert is probably provisioned into the enclave out-of-band or provisioned with one of the other bespoke attestation protocols. Ideally, you can keep the provisioning step out of the steady-state client path or do it only once.\n\n\nexport keying material (rare availability, if exists then only application layer changes)\n\nUsed in TLS Exported Keying Material Session Binding.

These middleware services usually terminate TLS at the provider's edge and then inspect or operate on the HTTP request/response to route traffic, cache responses, check user authentication/authorization, track metrics, attach tracing info, etc, etc...\nThe other protocols described in this note will terminate the TLS session inside the destination enclave service. The security model is definitely clearest when terminating at the destination; however, we also lose out on all the functionality provided by these middlewares and must replicate or otherwise go without them in the enclave service.\nIn contrast, this proposal runs an attestation protocol over HTTPS in a standard TLS session, which can be terminated normally at the edge. Both parties effectively do a key exchange over HTTP headers. Once negotiated, parts of subsequent HTTP requests can be protected via the shared secrets. The middlewares can continue to operate on the unprotected parts of the HTTP request as normal.\n\nSee: HTTPA/1.1: HTTPS Attestable Protocol\nSee: HTTPA/2: a Trusted End-to-End Protocol for Web Services\nSee: HTTPA - APNIC blog post\n\nEnclave Key Exchange Protocol (EKEP)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA modified version of Google's internal mutual-auth secure transport protocol (ALTS).

Some even support raw pubkey-only key exchange (no cert). This protocol proposes a new CWT cert format, along with an Entity Attestation Token (EAT) format inside the CWT cert.\nRequires deeply invasive changes to TLS client libraries, who almost always assume X509 certs.

You can use any cryptographic hash function, but some constants will need to change to accomodate the different digest block size.\nWhy this page: I keep forgetting perf-relevant details like ideal salt / IKM sizes, or HKDF salt/PRK caching. Seeing all the details laid out flat, with strong types, makes this all clear.

If you find yourself deriving secrets from multiple different IKMs, this trick may be useful.\nThe extracted PRK can be cached.

I've found this trick in particular can save between 60-70% on key derivation time.\n\n\n\nRFCs\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nRFC 2104: HMAC: Keyed-Hashing for Message Authentication\nRFC 5869: HKDF: HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/crypto/hkdf-sha256/","title":"hkdf-sha256"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/crypto/smallstep - private online CA & ACME server/":{"body":"smallstep - private online CA &amp; ACME server\n\n\nA private certificate authority (X.509 &amp; SSH) &amp; ACME server for secure automated certificate management, so you can use TLS everywhere &amp; SSO for SSH.\n\n\nSite: https://smallstep.com/certificates/index.html\nGithub: https://github.com/smallstep/certificates\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/crypto/smallstep - private online CA & ACME server/","title":"smallstep - private online CA & ACME server"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/crypto/tls exported keying material/":{"body":"tls exported keying material\n\nRFC 5705 - Keying Material Exporters for TLS\nwhat\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nExposes a KDF on the TLS connection shared secret that the client and server agreed upon.\nAPI\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nrustls::Connection::export_keying_material\nimpl Connection {\n    /// Derives key material from the agreed connection secrets.\n    ///\n    /// This function fills in `output` with `output.len()` bytes of\n    /// key material derived from the master session secret using\n    /// `label` and `context` for diversification.\n    pub fn export_keying_material(\n        &amp;self,\n        output: &amp;mut [u8],\n        label: &amp;[u8],\n        context: Option&lt;&amp;[u8]&gt;,\n    ) -&gt; Result&lt;(), Error&gt;;\n}\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/crypto/tls exported keying material/","title":"tls exported keying material"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/crypto/zkdocs/":{"body":"zkdocs\n\n\nZKDocs provides comprehensive, detailed, and interactive documentation on zero-knowledge proof systems and related primitives.\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/crypto/zkdocs/","title":"zkdocs"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/design/":{"body":"","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/design/","title":"design"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/design/form design/":{"body":"form design\n\nVideo: You Suck at Form Design\n10 Commandments of Form Design\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nAlign form elements.\nPlace labels above inputs.

When the pipe is full, it admits no more water and the pipe \"exerts backpressure\" on its inputs (who will now start filling up because they can't push their water forward to their outputs).  All the water sent into the pipe eventually ends up at the output.\nBackpressure is compositional: a series of simple pipes hooked end-to-end itself exerts backpressure. We can break the total system backpressure with a leaky pipe in the middle, which loses some of the water.\nIn systems terms, a pipe is a bounded FIFO queue.\nThe Allure of Backpressure\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA system designed with all parts exerting backpressure promises: \"use these simple tricks and your system will degrade gracefully under load! Lose no messages! Never OOM!\"\nA local system that fully exerts backpressure end-to-end provides a natural mechanism for propagating that backpressure to remote peers via TCP connections.\nIf an internal component is at capacity, it will eventually propagate to our local TCP connections for each peer, which will actually propagate to each remote peer's TCP socket. In other words, when we're under load, the system will naturally stop accepting new requests off the socket.\nIn the beginning, most advice looks like \"Every queue should have a maximum size. Queues must not grow unbounded.\"\nThe average async fan replaces all their unbounded channels with bounded channels and thinks they're done.\nThe average async enjoyer ...\nDeadlocks\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nProblems start to arise when loop branches or handlers need to await on some shared and limited resource, particularly when the system is under load. These resources are most often\n\nenqueueing messages on mpsc (multi-producer, single-consumer) bounded channels (for communication b/w actors)\nacquiring permits from concurrency limiting semaphores (to limit concurrent requests or spawned tasks)\nsending messages on a socket.\n\nWhen there's a wait cycle (e.g. task A waits on task B waits on task C waits on task A), the system deadlocks. Especially problematic is that deadlock issues tend to only crop up non-deterministically when the system is under load and the bounded queues start hitting capacity.\nIf your queue sizes are large and you're not running load tests, these problems will manifest in production at 3 am during your on-call shift.\nTrying to handle backpressure properly is difficult. It's not that hard to just throw bounded queues everywhere and pray, but this is not sufficient in my experience.\nIn fact, many systems decide to completely eschew handling backpressure internally. Erlang actors communicate exclusively using unbounded channels. Erlang also doesn't bound spawned tasks (until the process crashes or OOMs of course :)).\nThis approach almost completely avoids deadlocks at the cost of other problems like unbounded resource usage and exploding tail latencies when the system is under load. The request latency is the real killer; the system becomes unusable when all requests start timing out as the mean request service time exceeds the mean timeout.\nIn this sort of system, a typical approach is to bound external requests \"at the edges\" with the expectation that internal load will remain proportionally bounded. This could mean setting external request rate limits and total in-flight request limits at your loadbalancers, hoping that \"internal\" system utilization remains nominal.\nThe \"ideal\" way to avoid deadlocks with bounded channels is to design your system topology so there can never be wait cycles, i.e., all Actor communication follows a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Every node in this graph is an async event loop. Every directed edge in this graph is a bounded FIFO queue that starts from an mpsc::Sender and ends at an mpsc::Receiver. In a more perfect world, the Diem topology would be a DAG like:\nflowchart LR;\n    I[Inbound Network Messages] --&gt; M &amp; C &amp; S;\n\n\tC[Consensus] --&gt; S &amp; M &amp; O;\n\n\tS[State Sync] --&gt; M &amp; O;\n\n\tM[Shared Mempool] --&gt; O;\n\n\tO[Outbound Network Messages];\n\nUnfortunately, the current system grew organically and currently looks something like (heavily simplified):\nflowchart LR;\n\tO[Sockets x N] --&gt; P;\n\n\tP[Peers x N] --&gt; O &amp; N;\n\n    N[Peer Manager] --&gt; P &amp; C &amp; S &amp; M;\n\n\tM[Shared Mempool] --&gt; N;\n\n\tC[Consensus] --&gt; S &amp; M &amp; N;\n\n\tS[State Sync] --&gt; C &amp; M &amp; N;\n\nWait a second. Didn't we just advise against cycles? How do you avoid deadlocks??\nHere's a dirty little secret... Diem doesn't actually use bounded FIFO queues in most cases.\nThere's a lossy multi-queue implementation called diem_channel (very creative name, I know) which, if you squint a bit, looks like an Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;HashMap&lt;K, VecDeque&lt;V&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; . Their most common use is actually to provide fairness and quality-of-service across multiple peers and application protocols (Consensus, State Sync, Shared Mempool). It's like each PeerId x ProtocolId pair gets its own exclusive mini-queue separate from the others. The receiver round-robins across all the mini-queues (to provide fairness) when dequeue'ing. If one peer starts sending our node lots of messages, their queue will fill up, but also leaves the others unaffected.\nThese diem_channels are used in almost all of the edges above. These queues actually drop messages when at capacity, according to an eviction policy.\nMore generally, dropping messages is the other alternative to backpressure: you can't deadlock if you never block! Dropping messages has a price, however: protocols are more difficult to develop since they need to be robust against messages dropping at any time.\nThe Diem Consensus protocol even uses size=1 LIFO message \"slots\" for each peer, since the protocol only cares about the absolute most recent message (when optimized for min latency).\nNote that without backpressure, you don't have an obvious way to tell a peer to \"backoff\" and stop sending you messages when your system is under load. You must provide your own rate limits or ad-hoc protocol backoff messages.\nIt might not surprise you that distributed systems are not simple, and backpressure is not an exception. If there's anything you should take away from this article, it's that simple rules like \"bounded FIFO queues everywhere\" are just heuristics that should be followed with intention and understanding of the tradeoffs involved.\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/distributed systems/the siren song of backpressure/","title":"the siren song of backpressure"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/fuzzing/":{"body":"","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/fuzzing/","title":"fuzzing"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/fuzzing/bolero - fuzzing + property testing/":{"body":"bolero - fuzzing + property testing\n\nCrate: https://crates.io/crates/bolero\n\nLooks like what we were trying to do at Diem (integrate property testing and fuzzing).\nReplaces proptest.\nHooks into fuzzing engines and supports mutation-based fuzzing.\n\nhttps://camshaft.github.io/bolero/introduction.html\nhttps://camshaft.github.io/bolero/tutorials/fibonacci.html#test-oracle\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/fuzzing/bolero - fuzzing + property testing/","title":"bolero - fuzzing + property testing"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/fuzzing/fuzzcheck-rs/":{"body":"fuzzcheck-rs\n\nCoverage-guided, in-process, structure-aware, mutation-based fuzzing without the intermediate raw bytes serde step.\n\nGithub: https://github.com/loiclec/fuzzcheck-rs\nBook: https://fuzzcheck.neocities.org/\n\npotential improvements\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nfrom a maintainence standpoint, it's a pain to support both proptest and fuzzcheck-rs simultaneously.\n\ncan fuzzcheck-rs completely subsume the use cases where we normally use proptest?\nas normal, I can run cargo fuzzcheck &lt;my-fuzz-test&gt; for continuous fuzzing.\nhowever, I should be able to hit cargo test and all my fuzzers run in a \"simplified\" checking/testing mode where:\n\nthere is a default max duration (5 sec?) / max test cases value (10,000 execs?).\ngenerated corpus values/artifacts aren't saved to disk (unless something fails).\nIF a failing test case is found, either:\n\nimmediately start minifying the test input for some duration (15 sec?).\nprint out a copy-pasteable command the will minify that specific test.\n\n\nIf coverage is too expensive to track during tests, it wouldn't even be that bad to just disable it when cargo test'ing.\n\nin fact, I'm not sure how coverage would work if the tests are run in the same process.\na #[fuzzcheck::test] annotation could mandate tests use something like rusty-fork to fork the test process before running.\n\n\n\n\nOne advantage of proptest is that you can easily generate complex test inputs by composing the generator combinators.\n\nin contrast, it wasn't clear how to build a custom mutator composed of submutators (from my very brief look).\n\n\nBy using the same fuzzers for both continuous fuzzing and unit testing, we prevent fuzzers from going stale or otherwise drifting from the implementation.\n\nThis was a very real problem in a previous project.

If expr1 := eval(expr0), then expr1 can also be assigned type T. In other words, static type meaning is preserved under evaluation.\nProperty (Progress): Evaluation of an expression always \"makes progress\" towards a value. In other words, calling eval on an expression (and then on the result and so on) should eventually become a value.\nI Imagine progress is necessary for the compiler to prove that certain inductive types or recursive functions terminate or become structurally simpler with every inductive step.\nTuples\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n(* unboxed, flat tuple *)\nval xy = (123, \"abc\")\nval x = xy.0 and y = xy.1\n\n(* boxed tuple (ptr sized) *)\nval zw = '( -1.0, \"foo\")\nval z = zw.0 and w = zw.1\n\nNote that the space b/w '( and -1.0 is required for boxed tuples.

This @ binding also implicitly view-changes xs to viewtype list_vt_cons_unfold(l_0, l_1, l_2). These *_unfold(l_0, ..) viewtype definitions an autogenerated for all dataviewtype variants, where l_0 points to the outer dataviewtype and l_i points to field_i, where field_1 is the first field.\nAfter modifying x in the above let-block, notice that we also need this fold@(xs) proof statement.

FIB0 and FIB1 constructors both take () and return a proof.\nA dataprop for multiplication:\n// int * int = int\ndataprop MUL(int, int, int) =\n  // 0 * n = 0\n  | {n: int} MULbase(0, n, 0) of ()\n  // (m+1) * n = m*n + n\n  | {m: nat}{n: int}{p: int} MULind(m+1, n, p+n) of MUL(m, n, p)\n  // (-m) * n = -(m * n)\n  | {m: pos}{n: int}{p: int} MULneg(~(m), n, ~(p)) of MUL(m, n, p)\n\nTo prove this relation, we want to construct values of MUL for each parameter. The most common way to do this is to construct a total function over all parameters:\n// ∀ m ∈ ℕ, n ∈ ℤ, ∃ p ∈ ℤ : m * n = p\nprfun mul_nat_is_total {m: nat; n: int} .&lt;m&gt;. (): [p: int] MUL(m, n, p) =\n  sif m == 0 then\n    MULbas()\n  else\n    MULind(mul_nat_is_total{m-1, n}())\n\n// ∀ m, n ∈ ℤ, ∃ p ∈ ℤ : m * n = p\nprfn mul_is_total {m, n: int} (): [p: int] MUL(m, n, p) =\n  sif m &gt;= 0 then\n    mul_nat_is_total{m, n}()\n  else\n    MULneg(mul_nat_is_total{~m, n}())\n\nNote: the second proof function uses prfn rather than prfun for a specific reason: prfuns define recursive proof functions and thus require a termination metric. prfns must be non-recursive and therefore don't need a termination metric.\ndatasort: like a datatype but static. doesn't support any dependent type stuff i think. you must also use scase instead of case to match on datasorts.\nQ: what is the difference b/w a dataprop and a datasort??\nViews\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA view is a linear prop (linear as in must consume exactly once). views power ATS's pointer ownership checking.\nFor example, an owned pointer with a view to an a at location l looks like\n{a: t@ype} {l: addr} (pf: a @ l | p: ptr l)\n\nor a maybe uninitialized a\n(pf: a? @ l | p: ptr l)\nWhile managing these linear views can be done by threading the proofs through the in-params and out-params of each function, ATS provides a convenient syntactic sugar for modifying the view in-place. Consider the ptr_set function:\nfun {a: t@ype} ptr_set {l: addr} (\n  pf: !a? @ l &gt;&gt; a @ l\n| p: ptr l,\n  x: a\n): void\n\nWe can read the pf as \"the function takes a proof of a maybe-uninit a at location l and will modify this proof (in the caller's context) to a definitely-init a at location l\".\nIn general, the format looks like !V &gt;&gt; V' to mean that the function changes the view V to V' upon its return. If V = V', then you can just write !V or !V &gt;&gt; _ (TODO: what does this mean? does typechecker fill the hole?).\nManipulating Pointers\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nManually pass the proof in and out:\n// (pf: a @ l | p: ptr l)\nval x = ptr_get&lt;int&gt;(pf | p)\nval () = ptr_set&lt;int&gt;(pf | p, 123)\n\nOr use the pointer syntax:\n// these modify pf in-place\nval x = !p\nval () = !p := 123\n\nViewtypes\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nviewtypes are linear types in ATS. The name view + type suggests that a viewtype consists of a linear view V and type T. Usually we refer to viewtypes by their definition VT but you can actually split viewtypes into their component view V and type T (via pattern matching.)\n\n\nThis interpretation of a VT as a (V | T) could be thought of as encumbering a concrete, runtime value of type T with a linear tag V (which can also assert other properties ofc).\n\n\nGiven the viewtype VT we can compactly refer to the type portion by the syntax VT?!\n\n\nviewtype and viewt@ype are two sorts with the type portion in sorts type and t@ype resp.\n\n\nhttp://blog.vmchale.com/article/ats-linear\nhttps://bluishcoder.co.nz/2011/04/25/sharing-linear-resources-in-ats.html\nL-Values and Call-by-Reference\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nAn l-value is a pointer and linear at-view proof / \"value + address\"\nLike C/C++, l-values can appear on the left-hand side of assignments\nSimplest l-value is !p where p is a ptr l. the typechecker must also find an at-view proof a @ l somewhere in the context.\nNormally, ATS uses call-by-value; however, you can pass l-values by reference. When this happens, the address (and not the value) is passed.\nFunction can take reference with &amp; like fun foo(x: &amp;a). Note that you don't use ! to deref or assign, just the plain x.\n\nStack-Allocated Variables\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nUse var x: T to declare uninit stack variable or var y: T = val to init with val.\nUse view@(x) to get the view-type at the location inside x\nUse addr@(x) to get the location that x points to.\nInterestingly, you can see the the uninit decl. actually has type view@(x) = T? @ x while the init decl. has type view@(y) = T @ x\nvar z: int with pfz = 69 will bind pfz = view@(z) for you\nATS ensures there are no dangling or escaped stack pointers by requiring that the linear at-view proof must be present in the context when the function returns.\nCan also stack allocate flat arrays in the obvious way\n\nvar A = @[double][10]()\t\t\t\t// uninit stack array\nvar B = @[double][10](42.0)\t\t\t// size=10 stack array init w/ 42.0\nvar C = @[double](1.0, 2.0, 3.0)    // size=3 init w/ (1.0, ..)\n\n\nCan also stack allocate closures via lam@ (non-rec) and fix@ (rec)\n\nvar x: int = 123\nvar y: int = 69\n\nvar mul = lam@ (): int =&gt; x * y\n\nVariance (Rust)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe variance property of a generic type is relative to its generic arguments. For example, a generic type F has variance relative to its generic parameters (say F&lt;T&gt;, so F has variance relative to T). Variance tells us how/how not e.g. traits impls \"pass through\" the inner parameter type T to/from the outer generic type F.\nsubtype: T: U, T is \"at least as useful as\" U. For example, 'static: 'a since you can use static lifetimes anywhere some stricter lifetime 'a is needed.\nThere are three cases for variance: covariant, contravariant, and invariant.\n\n\ncovariant:\nhave fn foo(&amp;'a str), can call foo(&amp;'static str). we can provide foo with a stronger type than it requires.\nin this case, F&lt;_&gt; = &amp;'_ str.\n\n\ncontravariant:\nhave fn foo(Fn(&amp;'a str) -&gt; ()), can't provide foo(fn(&amp;'static str) {}). need to provide foo with a weaker type than it expects.\n\n\ninvariant:\nno additional subtyping relation can be derived\n\n\nVariance (ATS)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nYou can express covariance and contravariance (I believe?) in some parameter by adding a + or - to certain keyword types or something\nConfirmed this is true for view+ and prop+ for covariance. Just guessing on the rest.\nprop+ prop-\nview+ view-\n\ntype+ type-\ntbox+ tbox-\ntflt+ tflt-\n\ntypes+ types-\n\nvtype+ vtype-\nvtbox+ vtbox-\nvtflt+ vtflt-\n\nt0ype+ t0ype-\nvt0ype+ vt0ype-\n\nviewtype+ viewtype-\nviewt0ype+ viewt0ype-\n\nopt\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThere's a type constructor opt(T, B) where T is a type and B is a bool. If B = true then opt(T, B) is T and T? if B = false.\nllam (..) =&gt; .. appears to be a linear lambda closure?\n(..) -&lt;lin,prf&gt; .. appears to be type of linear, prfun closure?\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/lang/ATS/ATS2 Notes/","title":"ATS2 Notes"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/lang/ATS/Install ATS2/":{"body":"install ATS2\n\n$ git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:githwxi/ATS-Anairiats.git ats1\n$ git clone git@github.com:githwxi/ATS-Postiats.git ats2\n$ git clone git@github.com:githwxi/ATS-Postiats-contrib.git ats2-contrib\n\n$ sudo apt install build-essential automake-1.15 jgawk libgmp-dev libgc-dev libjson-c-dev\n\n$ echo \"export PATSHOME=\\$HOME/dev/ats2\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n$ echo \"export PATSCONTRIB=\\$HOME/dev/ats2-contrib\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n$ echo \"export PATH=\\$PATH:\\$PATSHOME/bin\" &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc\n\n$ cd ats1\n$ mkdir bootstrap1\n$ ./configure &amp;&amp; make all\n\n$ cd ../ats2\n$ make -f Makefile_devl all\n\nMake ctags in ATS src\n$ cd ~/dev/ats2\n$ ctags \\\n    --languages=ATS \\\n    --exclude=\"*atscc2*\" \\\n    --exclude=\"doc*\" \\\n    --exclude=\"npm-utils*\" \\\n    --exclude=\"*CODEGEN*\" \\\n    --exclude=\"*DOCUGEN*\" \\\n    --exclude=\"*TEST*\"\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/lang/ATS/Install ATS2/","title":"Install ATS2"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/lang/flutter/":{"body":"","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/lang/flutter/","title":"lang/flutter"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/lang/flutter/dart lang/":{"body":"dart lang\n\nvariables\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nmutable\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nvar name = 'Bob';\nObject name = 'Bob';\nString name = 'Bob';\nvar name = const 'Bob';\nname = 'Alice';\n\nimmutable\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nfinal name = 'Bob';\nfinal String name = 'Bob';\nname = 'Alice'; // &lt;&lt; compile error: final var can only be set once\nfinal String name = const 'Bob';\n\ncomptime\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nconst bar = 1000000;\nconst double atm = 1.01325 * bar;\nconst p1 = [bar, atm];\nconst p2 = const [bar, atm]; // &lt;&lt; style: const-value is redundant\n\n\nIf you enable null safety, then you must initialize the values of non-nullable variables before you use them.\n\nThe compiler can sometimes determine a lazy-init val is not null before use:\nint foo;\nif (isFooable) {\n\tfoo = 123;\n} else {\n\tfoo = 0;\n}\n\nprint(foo);\n\nlate init\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nUse the late modifier if dart can't prove non-null-before-use.

They let us define faux-methods on a type (using dot notation) when we would otherwise be restricted to a static point-free function. In the following example, we can use extension methods to make parseInt(\"123\") into a faux-method on String, like \"123\".parseInt().\n// point free version\nint parseInt(String s) =&gt; int.parse(s);\n\n// a named extension on String\nextension NumberParsing on String {\n  int parseInt() =&gt; int.parse(this);\n}\n\n// an unnamed, module-local extension\nextension on String {\n  int parseInt() =&gt; int.parse(this);\n}\n\nassert(int.parse(\"123\") == 123);\nassert(parseInt(\"123\") == 123);\nassert(\"123\".parseInt() == 123);\n\nYou can't invoke extension methods on values with type dynamic.\nIf two modules provide two extension methods of the same name on the same type, you will need to either (1) hide the extension for one of the modules or (2) namespace one of the modules with as.\nimport \"string_apis.dart\"; // defs String.parseInt() extension\nimport \"string_apis_2.dart\" hide NumberParsing2; // need to hide the second ext\n\n\"42\".parseInt();\n\nimport \"string_apis.dart\"; // defs NumberParsing ext\nimport \"string_apis_3.dart\" as foo; // defs NumberParsing ext\n\n\"42\".parseInt(); // &lt;&lt; ERROR\nNumberParsing(\"42\").parseInt();\nfoo.NumberParsing(\"42\").parseInt();\n\nenums\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nDart has basic C-style enums, like:\nenum Color { red, green, blue }\n\nThere's also \"enhanced enums\" which are NOT like real discriminated unions. This feature just allows enums to have methods and a fixed set of fields shared across all variants.\nUpdate(2023/07/14): dart 3 now includes sealed and final classes, plus exhaustive pattern matching. These two features let us mostly emulate real discriminated unions. For example, consider an enum like Rust's Result&lt;T, E&gt;:\npub enum Result&lt;T, E&gt; {\n  Ok(T),\n  Err(E),\n}\n\nWe can now mostly emulate this in dart 3:\nsealed class Result&lt;T, E&gt; {\n  const Result();\n\n  T? get ok;\n  E? get err;\n}\n\nfinal class Ok&lt;T, E&gt;(this.ok) extends Result&lt;T, E&gt; {\n  const Ok(this.ok);\n\n  @override\n  final T ok;\n  @override\n  E? get err =&gt; null;\n}\n\nfinal class Err&lt;T, E&gt;(this.ok) extends Result&lt;T, E&gt; {\n  const Err(this.err);\n\n  @override\n  final E err;\n  @override\n  T? get ok =&gt; null;\n}\n\nUsing it isn't too bad with exhaustive pattern matching:\nfinal Result&lt;int, String&gt; result = Ok(123);\n\n// using switch-expressions:\n\nfinal bool isOk123 = switch (result) {\n  Ok(:final ok) =&gt; ok == 123,\n  Err() =&gt; false,\n};\n\nassert(isOk123);\n\n// or switch-statements:\n\nfinal int value;\nswitch (result) {\n  case Ok(:final ok):\n    value = ok;\n  case Err(:final err):\n    print(\"Error: $err\");\n    return;\n}\n\nprint(\"value = $value\");\n// value = 123\n\nmixins\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nmixins are like abstract classes that can neither be extended nor constructed.\n\n(philip): looking through dart-lang std, it appears that mixins are almost never used? even interface-only cases, like Comparable&lt;T&gt;, are just abstract classes. consumers provide the interface by e.g. class X implements Comparable&lt;X&gt;.\n(philip): more std: main use case in std seems to be type-specialization? like \"implement List&lt;int&gt; more efficiently for Uint8List\".\nenum Ordering { less, equal, greater }\n\nmixin PartialOrd&lt;T&gt; {\n  Ordering? partialCmp(T other);\n}\n\nmixin Ord&lt;T&gt; on PartialOrd&lt;T&gt; {\n  Ordering cmp(T other);\n}\n\nclass BigInt with PartialOrd&lt;BigInt&gt;, Ord&lt;BigInt&gt; {\n  final List&lt;int&gt; limbs;\n\n  const BigInt() : this.limbs = const [];\n\n  @override\n  Ordering? partialCmp(BigInt other) =&gt; cmp(other);\n\n  @override\n  Ordering cmp(BigInt other) {\n    final lenThis = this.limbs.length;\n    final lenOther = other.limbs.length;\n\n    if (lenThis &lt; lenOther) {\n      return Ordering.less;\n    } else if (lenThis &gt; lenOther) {\n      return Ordering.greater;\n    } else {\n\t  for (var i = lenThis - 1; i &gt;= 0; i--) {\n        final limbThis = this.limbs[i];\n        final limbOther = other.limbs[i];\n\n        if (limbThis &lt; limbOther) {\n          return Ordering.less;\n        } else if (limbThis &gt; limbOther) {\n          return Ordering.greater;\n        }\n      }\n\n      return Ordering.equal;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nlibraries\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n// dart-core packages are prefixed with \"dart:\"\n// like: `use std::collect::*;`\nimport \"dart:collection\";\n// external packages are prefixed with \"package:\"\n// like: `use serde::de::*;`\nimport \"package:lib1/lib1.dart\";\n\n// namespace import\n// like: `use std::collection as std_collection;`\nimport \"dart:collection\" as stdCollection;\n\n// only import parts of library\n// like: `use std::collection::{VecDeque, BTreeMap};`\nimport \"dart:collection\" show Queue, Set;\n\n// import all but hide some things\nimport \"dart::collection\" hide Queue, Set;\n\nasync/await\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nFuture&lt;String&gt; lookup() async =&gt; \"123\";\nFuture&lt;String&gt; lookup() async =&gt; await http.fetch(\"google.com\");\n\nDart uses a single-threaded async runtime, though you can spawn background workers with no shared state that communicate solely through message passing.\nenable the unawaited_futures lint\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIn stock dart, you can call async methods without awaiting them, which is super suprising to me. Enabling the unawaited_futures lint will tell the compiler to yell at you if you accidentally call an async method without awaiting it. This is like the #[must_use] attribute in Rust but only for dart's Futures.\nBe sure to enable this lint early on in a project, since a lot of standard flutter code likes to play fast and loose with ignoring futures.\nNote that there are some occasions where you want to call an async function but not await the returned future, like Navigator.push(), which actually returns a Future&lt;T?&gt; for the value the new route eventually yields when it Navigator.pop()s. In this particular case, the method synchronously pushes the new route onto the navigation stack and just returns a future for the popped value. If you don't care about the value, use the dart:async unawaited() function, which ignores the returned future:\nunawaited(Navigator.push(context, route));\n\nYou should only use unawaited on a future if you're sure it won't return an error. If you don't care about the result regardless, you can use FutureExtensions.ignore like:\nimport 'dart:async' show FutureExtensions;\n\nNavigator.push(context, route).ignore();\n\nUnfortunately, this lint only tells you about unawaited futures... in async code. Which is why you should also...\nenable the discarded_futures lint\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThis is like unawaited_futures but also works in sync code. It should be renamed to unawaited_futures_sync IMO.

Here are the ones defined in Idris' prelude:\nmodule Prelude.Ops\n\n-- Numerical operators\ninfix 6 ==, /=, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=\ninfixl 8 +, -\ninfixl 9 *, /\n\n-- Boolean operators\ninfixr 5 &amp;&amp;\ninfixr 4 ||\n\n-- List and String operators\ninfixr 7 ::, ++\ninfixl 7 :&lt;\n\n-- Functor/Applicative/Monad/Algebra operators\ninfixl 1 &gt;&gt;=, =&lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, &gt;=&gt;, &lt;=&lt;, &lt;&amp;&gt;\ninfixr 2 &lt;|&gt;\ninfixl 3 &lt;*&gt;, *&gt;, &lt;*\ninfixr 4 &lt;$&gt;, $&gt;, &lt;$\ninfixl 8 &lt;+&gt;\n\n-- Utility operators\ninfixr 9 ., .:\ninfixr 0 $\n\ninfixl 9 `div`, `mod`\n\nand the documentation for infix(r|l):\n&gt; :doc infix\nFixity declarations:\n\n  Operators can be assigned a priority level and associativity.\n  During parsing operators with a higher priority will collect their\n  arguments first and the declared associativity will inform how subterms\n  are grouped.\n\n  For instance the expression `a + b * c * d + e` is parsed as\n\n  `(a + ((b * c) * d)) + e` because:\n    `(+)` is at level 8 and associates to the left\n    `(*)` is at level 9 and associates to the left\n\nTo understand how these expressions are parsed, we need to understand the properties of all operators.\n\nArity (the number of inputs)\nFixity (infix, prefix, postfix)\nAssociativity (how parentheses are placed)\nPrecedence (the order of operations between different operators)\n\nArity\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nOperator arity refers to the number of inputs of an operator. The most common arities with some examples:\n\nNullary (zero inputs): less of an operator and more of a constant.\nUnary (one input): e.g., boolean negation ! or bitwise-not ~.\nBinary (two inputs): e.g., arithmetic +,-,*,/\n\nFixity\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nOperator fixity describes the operator's position in the list of arguments. There are three fixities:\n\nPrefix (operator comes before arguments): e.g., typical function application plus 3 4 or forced prefix form (+) 3 4\nInfix (operator comes between arguments): e.g., all arithmetic 3 + 4\nPostfix (operator comes after arguments): e.g., RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) or concatinative languages 3 4 +\n\nAssociativity\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nOperator associativity determines how the inner-most parentheses are placed when parsing an expression with the same operator (or same precedence).\nFor example, if you have the expression a ◯ b ◯ c ◯ d with some operator ◯, there are 5 ways we can parse it:\n\n((a ◯ b) ◯ c) ◯ d &lt;-- left associative\na ◯ (b ◯ (c ◯ d)) &lt;-- right associative\n(a ◯ b) ◯ (c ◯ d)\na ◯ ((b ◯ c) ◯ d)\n(a ◯ (b ◯ c)) ◯ d\n\nIn other words, left associative means we place the inner-most parentheses around the left-most pair, while right associative prefers the right-most pair.\nOperators can also be non-associative, which means a ◯ b ◯ c should fail to parse. An example would be relational operators like x &lt;= y &lt;= z, since (x &lt;= y) &lt;= z would fail to type check, as you would be comparing a boolean to a z.\nPrecedence\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nOperator precedence allows us to parse expressions containing multiple different operators without ambiguity. Precedence is a number; higher numbers mean higher priority when parsing.\nI like to imagine parsing precedence for an expression in passes. The first pass we parse only operators of precedence 10.

Ex: Scope provides a reactive scope.\nA Signal wraps a value and lets you listen for changes to that value.\nTo actually listen on a Signal, you need to call signal.get() inside a listener scope (which is not the same as a reactive scope).\nNotably, #[component] function bodies do not provide a listener scope, so calling signal.get() in a component won't re-render the component if the signal changes. However, the view! { ctx, _ } macro body provides an implicit listener scope when interpolating.\nmethodargsreturnsdescription\nctx.create_effectFnMut()()calls closure when a signal changes (signal.get() must be called in the closure to register it). used to impl most other methods here\nctx.create_memoFnMut() -&gt; U&amp;ReadSignal&lt;U&gt;calls closure when a registered signal changes and wraps the return value as a derived signal.\nctx.create_selectorFnMut() -&gt; U&amp;ReadSignal&lt;U&gt;calls closure when a registered signal changes. like create_memo but the derived signal only notifies if the return value is actually different from the previous value (Note: U must impl PartialEq).\nctx.create_reducerU, FnMut(&amp;U, Msg) -&gt; U(&amp;ReadSignal&lt;U&gt;, Fn(Msg))calls closure whenver the message handler Fn(Msg) gets called. kind of like an async fold, where the closure is an actor message handler.\nsignal.mapctx, FnMut(&amp;T) -&gt; U&amp;ReadSignal&lt;U&gt;calls closure with signal value whenever signal changes. returns derived signal with return value.\n\nFor (all?) of the above methods, we always call the closure once initially. This also allows us to observe all the signal.get()s inside the closure, which we need to register which signals to listen on.\nFor example, to see how reactivity works with the view! macro, we can look at how it (approximately) is expanded:\n// before expansion\nlet state = ctx.create_signal(0);\nview! { ctx,\n\tp {\n\t\t(state.get())\n\t}\n}\n\n// after expansion\nlet state = ctx.create_signal(0);\n{\n    let element = GenericNode::element(p);\n    let text = GenericNode::text(String::new());\n\t// Update text when `state` changes.\n    ctx.create_effect(move || {\n        text.update_text(Some(&amp;state.get()));\n\t});\n    element.append(&amp;text);\n    element\n}\n\nAs you can see, interpolations happen inside an implicit create_effect, which does not happen for signals retrieved outside a view! macro.\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/lang/rust/understanding sycamore reactivity/","title":"understanding sycamore reactivity"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/management/":{"body":"","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/management/","title":"management"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/management/relieve often - why generals were more successful in WWII/":{"body":"relieve often - why generals were more successful in WWII\n\nSource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxZWxxZ2JGE\nThesis: During WWII, commanders were relieved early and often. Afterwards, tacit policy of never firing, never relieving, and frequent deployment rotation leads to culture of stagnation and risk-aversion.\n\nMarshall was sworn into office on the eve of WWII. He knew the US was unprepared and the existing general staff was too old and incompetant--he fired almost all of them.\nCommand expected results from new commanders in 60-90 days. If you fail to deliver, you are relieved (NOT fired, but effectively demoted or reshuffled).\n+ Is relief like moving laterally inside Corp? Usually lateral movement is employee initiated, but can also be \"suggested\" by manager, so maybe different.\n+ Engineers and managers usually move laterally every 1-3 years. Fresh problems, fresh people--keeps one from getting comfortable.\nClaim: as relief becomes more commonplace, it feels less like a punishment.\nRelieved commanders could often regain or exceed their old positions in only a year if they had success again.\nUse relief as a tool to prevent complacency--if you notice someone just coasting, relieve them. Need to keep them engaged.\nTwo extremes of management: micromanagement vs complete autonomy. Relief is the price of autonomy. Relief allows managerial \"liquidity\", like a credit card. You are given a loan of autonomy with the price (relief) due in 60-90 days if you don't succeed.\n+ Imagine in Corp you get a manager promo / extra headcount / project lead for a half, then reshuffled if you don't hit success criteria.\n+ Claim: prevents the Peter Principle (every employee rises to their level of incompetence) by facilitating quick level promotions (to find their plateau) then quickly relieving once you've exceeded their plateau.\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/management/relieve often - why generals were more successful in WWII/","title":"relieve often - why generals were more successful in WWII"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/":{"body":"","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/","title":"misc"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/arm target triples/":{"body":"arm target triples\n\nSource: https://bgamari.github.io/posts/2019-06-12-arm-terminology.html\nTripleArchitectureEndiannessFloating pointABI\nARMv8\naarch64-linux-gnuAArch64LittleHardLinux\narmv8l-linux-gnuAArch32LittleHardLinux\nARMv7\narmv7l-linux-gnueabiARMv7LittleSoftLinux\narmv7l-linux-gnueabihfARMv7LittleHardLinux\narmv7a-linux-gnueabiARMv7LittleSoftLinux\narmv7a-linux-gnueabihfARMv7LittleHardLinux\narmv7-linux-androideabiARMv7LittleSoft?Linux\nARMv6\narm-linux-gnueabiARMv6LittleSoftLinux\narm-linux-gnueabihfARMv6LittleHardLinux\narm-none-eabiARMv6LittleSoftEmbedded\narm-none-eabihfARMv6LittleHardEmbedded\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/arm target triples/","title":"arm target triples"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/envsubst/":{"body":"envsubst\n\n\nSubstitute environment variables ($VARS) in stdin with current env values and output to stdout.\n\nexamples\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n# envsubst\n#\n# Substitutes environment variables with their value in shell format strings.\n# Variables to be replaced should be in either `${var}` or `$var` format.\n#\n# More information: &lt;https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/envsubst-Invocation.html&gt;.\n\n# Replace environment variables in stdin and output to stdout:\n$ echo 'I live at $HOME.' | envsubst\nI live at /home/phlip9.\n\n# Replace environment variables in an input file and output to stdout:\n$ cat path/to/input_file\nI live at $HOME.\nMy name is $USERNAME.\n\n$ envsubst &lt;

Note: this will only affect the commit hashes of the pub repo history after push. The changes in each commit will still appear (almost) exactly the same, i.e., they're still in the root directory.\n(2) (alt) git subrepo\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSkip step (1) if you use this approach.\nThe git subrepo tool is a user-friendly alternative to the git submodule and git subtree commands.\n(macOS)$ brew install git-subrepo\n\n# git subrepo clone &lt;remote-url&gt; &lt;subdir&gt;\n~/mono$ git subrepo clone ../pub ./pub-dir\n\nUnfortunately, git subrepo clone squashes all the commit history before the merge. If you're just looking to vendor a dependency or don't care about the original history, this approach might be for you.\n(2) (alt) git subtree add\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSkip step (1) if you use this approach.\ngit subtree is a built-in tool that lets you keep other repos phyiscally inside your main repo.

This method effectively creates a new tree object in the git db whose contents are a single subdirectory with the pub/master root tree. We then create a merge commit pointing to (1) the existing mono repo master commit and (2) the new manually created commit.\nUnfortunately, while the end result looks almost the same as [[#(1) move all files in pub into the subdirectory]], it appears to break git blame. :'(\n~/mono$ git remote add public ../public\n~/mono$ git fetch --no-tags public master\n~/mono$ git read-tree --prefix=public/ public/master\n~/mono$ git write-tree\nf1b1ee12e1d679ec84c282049102e2654efc4b67\n\n~/mono$ git commit-tree f1b1ee12e1d679ec84c282049102e2654efc4b67 \\\n\t-p master -p public/master -m \"monorepo merge\"\n046d3298b9976d50fa379fa071f57bc1158aca5b\n\n~/mono$ git reset 046d3298b9976d50fa379fa071f57bc1158aca5b &amp;&amp; git restore .\n\n~/mono$ git lg\n*   854b553 - monorepo merge (HEAD -&gt; master)\n|\\\n* | 5b02f51 - mono: add backend (origin/master)\n| * 7709d49 - pub: add client (public/master)\n\nother monorepo tools\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\n(java) google/copybara\n(hack) facebook/fbshipit - Copy commits b/w repos\n(php) symplify/monorepo-split-gh-action\n(sh) ingydotnet/git-subrepo\n(py) newren/git-filter-repo\n(go) splitsh/lite\n(sh) SimonBaeumer/sync-monorepo\n\\[\n\\]\n\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/git multirepo to monorepo/","title":"git multirepo to monorepo"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/kintsugi/":{"body":"kintsugi\n\n\nKintsugi (金継ぎ, \"golden joinery\") is the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery by mending the areas of breakage with lacquer dusted or mixed with powdered gold, silver, or platinum.\nAs a philosophy, it treats breakage and repair as part of the history of an object, rather than something to disguise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, watch this introductory 5 min video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJ23t940UY\nphilip's first attempt\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWith the broken pieces in front of you, first \"dry fit\" them together and plan the order you'll join each piece.\nThe fewer pieces you have, the easier it'll be. Two or three separate pieces seems best as far as outcome, but you usually don't get to choose how your favorite bowl shatters on the kitchen floor : )\nLightly sand the edges, then wash the pieces to get rid of the dust. Quickly dry with a paper towel.\nNow you're ready to glue pieces together! You can either try to glue everything in one go, or play it safe and glue one section at a time, letting the join dry for an hour or two and only then gluing the next section. I tried to glue all 5 of my pieces together at once and it was definitely too much. Next attempt I'll probably go one-at-a-time.\nPrepare the glue and (fake) gold powder mix. Now's also a good time to lay out a piece of cardboard to work on. Uncap the epoxy (don't worry, it's resealable!) and press out so you get even parts of each epoxy component. Then put a small bit of gold powder on the liquids. You need a lot less than you think! Add just a little bit, mix in with the epoxy, and see if it looks good. Worst case it looks a bit thin and you just add some more powder.\nMix the epoxy thoroughly. I spent maybe 1m 30sec mixing. Really scrape up the stuff on the surface and mix it up, otherwise the epoxy won't bond properly.\nWith a cheap wooden chopstick or plastic knife, gather up a little gold glue and bead it along one edge of a piece. You want enough so that it bulges out just a little when pressed together. One good reason to do a pair of pieces at a time is that you'll learn how much you need after the first join, and won't be rushed on the next. You may also need to add a little extra to fill in areas where the ceramics are chipped and don't sit flush.\nPress together the two glued pieces and hold until it sets. Repeat for all the different pieces.\nOnce the piece has dried, you can do a final \"touch up\" with an x-acto knife. Scrape off any stray splatters or cut-even any messy lines. Do this carefully so you don't leave any big marks.\nIf you really mess up and accidentally smudge the glue before it's set (like I did), or just don't like the look, you can try again. Take an x-acto knife and scrape/cut off the glue above the join, leaving the pieces still glued together and the surface now flush. Maybe sand it a bit too? Who knows. Unfortunately, the glue beneath the surface isn't as shiny, so mix some more glue + gold powder and this time lay a small, thin layer on the already-glued surface.\nThe pros seem to do this by painting a clear glue on the surface with a very thin brush, then dusting the gold powder on top. I don't have a brush though, so I just mixed the glue+powder and used another chopstick.\nAs a final note, the epoxy I bought doesn't appear to be food safe, so don't eat with your repaired ceramics!\nother helpful resources\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA useful comment from the video:\n\nFirstly, if it's for something you eat on then it needs to be food-safe this is less to do with actually eating it and more about toxic stuff that can come out when you wash it or if it comes into contact with acidic foods or something. Food safe glue sometimes it's sold as 'epoxy' rather than glue. The recommendation is to ask your local arts &amp; craft store about it as there are literally hundreds of brands.\nSecondly, even if you find food-safe glue just beware that most glues are not designed to withstand boiling water so gluing a teapot like this might not be the best idea.\nThirdly, the recommendation is to use a two-part mix glue (like you have to add the parts together first before gluing) they are usually slower drying and thicker. You want the glue to make up part of the crack (as compared to superglue which is so thin you can effectively attach two pieces together with no gap) Another recommendation is to mix the gold powder in with the glue first, so it's gold powder suspended in the glue. just because the dusting on at the end makes quite a thin covering and it can wash off easily if you rub it however if you are using actual gold then don't do that as it's a huge waste. We used craft store gold powder.\nLastly, another recommendation is to glue it first, then sand it back, and then use a fine brush to add some more glue and gold powder so the lines are thinner, more delicate, and flush with the ceramic.\n\nUnfortunately, the epoxy I bought doesn't appear the be food safe, so these will just have to be for display only.\nAnother nice video: https://youtu.be/eO9CnS-NqO8\n\nThe next step is to sand the edges. It took me about an hour. My theory was to sand the \"edge-of-the-edge\" on each piece, so there would be a bit of a gap between two broken pieces, but the two pieces would still fit together exactly in the mostly unsanded middle.\nSwap between sanding an edge, then fitting it together and looking at the gap, then back to sanding some more. Imagine there is gold between the gap; keep sanding if you want more gold to show. If you don't sand much, you'll get a hairline strip of gold. If you sand more, you'll get a wider, thicker join.\n\nThough this didn't work as well as I thought.\nwishlist for next time\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\na fine brush for detail work\na new x-acto knife\nwant to try some polish-level grit sandpaper\nbuy a higher end kit with real gold + silver powder: https://kintsugi-kit.com/products/traditional-tsugukit-gold-silver\nfollow this blog's more legit process: https://fellerts.no/projects/kintsugi.php\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/kintsugi/","title":"kintsugi"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/optimization solvers/":{"body":"optimization solvers\n\nUseful HN thread with pointers\nMiniZinc Challenge - Benchmarks and optimality for different solvers on different problems\nHans Mittelmann - Benchmarks for Optimization Software\nGoogle OR-Tools\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nGoogle OR-Tools\n\nLarge suite of solvers for ILP (via different backends), built-in LP, graph flows, combinatorial optimization.\nOpen source, Apache 2.0, lots of activity\n\nOSQP\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nOperator Splitting Quadratic Program (OSQP)\n\nsupports convex optimization problems\nclaims performance competitive with Gurobi\nfree, open-source, academic license\nwritten in C, easily embeddable, has a Rust interface osqp.rs\na CUDA implementation also exists? very nice. cuosqp\n\nGurobi\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nGurobi\n\ncommerical, paid licenses\nlicense model not really tuned for production deployment to cloud infrastructure\nby far the most comprehensive toolkit\ntypically the fastest on most problems I've used it on\nused it a long time ago for a CS170 project phlip9/Kidney-Exchange-Solvers which needed a Mixed-Integer Linear Problem (MILP) solver\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/optimization solvers/","title":"optimization solvers"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/misc/pop_OS! tweaks/":{"body":"pop_OS! tweaks\n\nUI gets slow and choppykjkj\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nrestart gnome-shell: ALT-F2 &gt; \"r\" &gt; Enter\n\nTry also disabling ubuntu-appindicators extension: Super &gt; Extensions &gt; Ubuntu AppIndicators &gt; Disable\nGraphics drivers stop working after apt upgrade / kernel update\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe nvidia graphics drivers are likely too old for the new kernel version.\nFor example, when I was upgrading to the new kernel (6.1.8 I think?), my older nvidia drivers (510) failed to build the nvidia/510 dkms kernel module for some inscrutable reason.\nYou can procrastinate on fixing this for a bit, by setting the previous kernel version as the default boot kernel.

The board should power up and show the little demo; press the UP button to go to the next screen.\nOn your machine, a USB-drive called CIRCUITPY should also pop up. This is the Adafruit Matrix Portal set up with CircuitPython ready for programming.\nThe Matrix Portal's got lots of features and room for other peripherals and sensors. it can even connect to stuff on the internet, so you can make a weather display, read some tweets, show the bitcoin price... : )\nIn the CIRCUITPY directory, there should be a code.py file. This contains the code for the demo, which is also listed below, see: demo code.\nCircuitPython makes it super painless to write code for little microcontroller boards like this. It ain't gonna be the fastest, but it's pretty easy to get stated. To get some basic code going, you literally just edit the code.py file, save it, and the board will auto-restart with the new updates.\nI'd probably start with the Mu editor here: https://codewith.mu/en/download. It's bare-bones, but it'll work in the beginning.\nI've already setup the board so everything should be good to go. With the board plugged in, just open the Mu editor, press the \"Mode\" icon, and select \"CircuitPython\". Then you should be able to edit the code, save, and see the changes appear on the device.\nAlso check out Adafruit's MatrixPortal overview: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-matrixportal-m4/overview\nand the CircuitPython Essentials guide: https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-essentials\nand the detailed CircuitPython core modules documentation: https://docs.circuitpython.org/en/latest/shared-bindings/index.html\nblink the board LED\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nHere's a basic example to get started: it blinks an LED on the board itself (not the display) on/off every 0.5 seconds.\n# file: code.py\n\nimport board\nimport digitalio\nimport time\n\n# This a the little red LED on the MatrixPortal m4 board,\n# not the big LED matrix panel. It's located right above\n# the \"adafruit\" logo.\nled = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.LED)\nled.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT\n\n# This block loops endlessly\nwhile True:\n    # Turn on the LED, then wait for 0.5 seconds\n    led.value = True\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n\n    # Turn off the LED, then wait for 0.5 seconds\n    led.value = False\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n\ngetting help from the REPL\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe panel opened by the \"Serial\" button doesn't just show the print output of the device, but also let's you interact with it. This is called a REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop) and lets you quickly play with bits of code or explore different modules.\nTo enter the REPL:\nIf your program has finished, you should see this message:\nAuto-reload is on. Simply save files over USB to run them or enter REPL to disable.\ncode.py output:\n\nCode done running.\n\nPress any key to enter the REPL. Use CTRL-D to reload.\n\nIn this case just press the \"Enter\" key in the Serial box and you should see the REPL pop up:\nAdafruit CircuitPython 7.3.3 on 2022-08-29; Adafruit Matrix Portal M4 with samd51j19\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\nIf some code is running (like the infinite blink example above), you may need to hit CTRL-C to stop the program first (though it seems a bit flaky, I had to hold the keys down for a second or two to get it to work).\nWith the REPL open, we can see all the available built-in modules by typing \"import \" (with the space) then hitting the TAB key to auto-complete:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import ^TAB\nbuiltins        micropython     __future__      _asyncio\n_bleio          adafruit_bus_device\nadafruit_bus_device.i2c_device  adafruit_bus_device.spi_device\nadafruit_pixelbuf               alarm           analogio\narray           atexit          audiobusio      audiocore\naudioio         audiomixer      audiomp3        binascii\nbitbangio       bitmaptools     board           busio\ncollections     countio         digitalio       displayio\nerrno           fontio          framebufferio   frequencyio\ngc              getpass         gifio           i2cperipheral\nio              json            keypad          math\nmicrocontroller                 msgpack         neopixel_write\nonewireio       os              ps2io           pulseio\npwmio           rainbowio       random          re\nrgbmatrix       rotaryio        rtc             samd\nsdcardio        select          storage         struct\nsupervisor      synthio         sys             terminalio\ntime            touchio         traceback       usb_cdc\nusb_hid         usb_midi        uselect         vectorio\nwatchdog        zlib\n\nDon't worry about what most of these do for now.\nIf you want to get very very detailed documentation about these modules, you can check the CircuitPython Modules reference.\nLet's check out the time module we used in the previous example:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import time\n&gt;&gt;&gt; help(time)\nobject &lt;module 'time'&gt; is of type module\n  __name__ -- time\n  monotonic -- &lt;function&gt;\n  sleep -- &lt;function&gt;\n  struct_time -- &lt;class 'struct_time'&gt;\n  localtime -- &lt;function&gt;\n  mktime -- &lt;function&gt;\n  time -- &lt;function&gt;\n  monotonic_ns -- &lt;function&gt;\n\nWe can get the number of seconds since the board powered on by calling time.monotonic():\n&gt;&gt;&gt; time.monotonic()\n1003.53\n\nWe use this one a lot in the demo.\nFrom the REPL we can define functions and variables just like we expect:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def f(x):\n\t# f(x) = 4x^2 - 4x - 24\n\tx_squared = x**2\n    return 4*x_squared - 4*x - 24\n&gt;&gt;&gt; f(0)\n-24\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(\"wow look f(3) is zero:\", f(3))\n\nWe can exit the REPL again by hitting CTRL-D.\ndisplaying text\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThis example requires the adafruit_display_text and adafruit_matrixportal libraries, which are not built-in modules. Most interesting libraries are not built-in, as they are updated more frequently than the base modules and would otherwise take up too much space on the device.\nTo install these community libraries, go to https://circuitpython.org/libraries and download the zip file under \"Bundle for Version 7.X\" (I've installed CircuitPython version 7.3.3).\nOpening the adafruit-circuitpython-bundle-7.x.zip file there should be a lib folder, with the adafruit_display_text and adafruit_matrixportal folders inside (among many others).\nCopy the those two folders from the .zip file to the mounted CIRCUITPY/lib/ folder to install the library.\nimport terminalio\n\nfrom adafruit_display_text import label\nfrom adafruit_matrixportal.matrix import Matrix\n\n# This call creates the Matrix display object.\n#\n# `bit_depth` can range from 1 to 6; higher numbers allow\n# for more color shades to be displayed, but increase memory\n# usage and slow down your Python code.\n#\n# If you just want to show primary colors\n# plus black and white, use 1.

the debug light flashes and a USB-drive called MATRIXBOOT mounts on the connected machine.\nIf nothing happens, make sure the USB-C cable you're using supports data transfer and not just power.\nThe pre-installed contents of the drive:\n$ ls /media/phlip9/MATRIXBOOT\nCURRENT.UF2\nINDEX.HTM\nINFO_UF2.TXT\n\nWe then install the CircuitPython \"OS\" onto the board:\n$ cd /tmp\n$ wget https://downloads.circuitpython.org/bin/matrixportal_m4/en_US/adafruit-circuitpython-matrixportal_m4-en_US-7.3.3.uf2\n$ cp adafruit-circuitpython-matrixportal_m4-en_US-7.3.3.uf2 /media/phlip9/MATRIXBOOT\n\nThe lights should flash a bit and the disk will unmount from your machine. A second later another USB disk mounts called CIRCUITPY.\nDownload and install the Mu editor.\nOn linux I had to add my user, phlip9, to the dialout group and then restart for Mu+CircuitPython to work. macOS and Windows users can skip this step.\n$ sudo adduser phlip9 dialout\n\nOpen the Mu editor and select \"Mode\", then choose \"CircuitPython\".

Today this is mostly a legacy detail that was later replaced, but the \"class-less\" in CIDR refers to the lack of distinct classes in CIDR, which instead uses \"variable-length subnet masking\" (VLSM) to allocate network prefixes along any bit boundary.\nSubnet Mask\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nTo refresh, a subnet mask is just a bitmask we use to AND against the IP to retrieve the network prefix. Likewise, if we invert the subnet mask then AND against the IP, we get the host id.\nFor example, if we have the LAN IP 192.168.3.5 with subnet mask 255.255.254.0, then our network prefix is 192.168.2.0 and the host id is 0.0.1.5. This might be clearer if you see the bits written out explicitly.\n1100 0000 . 1010 1000 . 0000 0011 . 0000 0101   ip\n1111 1111 . 1111 1111 . 1111 1110 . 0000 0000   subnet_mask\n1100 0000 . 1010 1000 . 0000 0010 . 0000 0000   network_prefix = ip &amp; subnet_mask\n0000 0000 . 0000 0000 . 0000 0001 . 0000 0101   host_id = ip &amp; !subnet_mask\n\nAs we'll see in a moment, this IP+mask in equivalent CIDR notation would be 192.168.3.5/23.\nHistorically, a full 32-bit bitmask was used to differentiate between which part of an IPv4 address was the network prefix and which part was the host identifier.\nFor a while, subnet masks could be any arbitrary non-contiguous bitmask; however, some RFCs eventually mandated that they must be contiguous, starting from the most-significant bit. As we'll see in a moment, an IP with a subnet mask and an IP in CIDR notation are 100% equivalent nowadays.\nCIDR notation\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nInstead of writing out the whole subnet mask, we can instead write just the number of leading ones in the subnet mask (called the mask width) alongside the IP. This format is called CIDR notation.\nUsing the same example as above, the ip 192.168.3.5 with subnet mask 255.255.254.0 would be written as 192.168.3.5/23 in CIDR notation.\nDeriving that more explicitly in Rust code:\nlet ip: Ipv4Addr = \"192.168.3.5\".into();\nlet mask_width = 23;\nlet subnet_mask = !(0xffff_ffff_u32 &gt;&gt; mask_width);\nlet network_prefix: Ipv4Addr = (ip.as_u32() &amp; subnet_mask).into();\nlet host_id: Ipv4Addr = (ip.as_u32() &amp; !subnet_mask).into();\n\nI used to get confused on whether the CIDR mask width refers to the subnet mask or host id mask. A simple memnonic helps me remember:\n\nthe CIDR number is on the right, so we shift ones right (to make the mask).\n\nNote that CIDR notation works the exact same for IPv6, except we have 128 bits to play with instead of just 32 bits.\nAnother useful insight to remember: the CIDR mask width goes from least specific (/0) to most specific (/32).\nCIDR block\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWhen describing a range of IPs, we often write an IP in CIDR notation with the bits outside the network prefix set to zero.\nSome examples:\nAddress RangeCIDR blockNumber of addresses\n192.168.0.0 -&gt; 192.168.255.255192.168.0.0/162^16 = 65,536\n172.16.0.0 -&gt; 172.31.255.255172.16.0.0/122^20 = 1,048,576\n10.0.0.0 -&gt; 10.255.255.25510.0.0.0/82^24 = 16,777,216\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/networking/CIDR/","title":"CIDR"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/networking/ipv6 address space/":{"body":"ipv6 address space\n\nSee: IANA &gt; Internet Protocol Version 6 Address Space\nSee: IANA &gt; IPv6 Special-Purpose Address Registry\nprefixnameRFCS\n0000::/8Reserved\n-&gt; ::1/128LoopbackRFC4291\n-&gt; ::/128Bind to unspecified interfaceRFC4291\n-&gt; ::ffff:0:0/96IPv4-mapped addressesRFC4291\n-&gt; 64:ff9b::/96Algorithmic IPv4/IPv6 translation prefixRFC6052\n-&gt; 64:ff9b:1::/48Local-use IPv4/IPv6 translation prefixRFC8215\n0100::/8Discard-only BlockRFC6666\n2000::/3Global UnicastRFC4291\n-&gt; 2001::/32TEREDO - tunnel IPv6 over UDP through NATsRFC4380\n-&gt; 2001:1::1/128Port Control Protocol (PCP) static AnycastRFC7723\n-&gt; 2001:1::2/128TURN static AnycastRFC8155\n-&gt; 2001:2::/48Reserved for benchmarkingRFC5180\n-&gt; 2001:3::/32Automatic Multicast Tunneling (AMT)RFC7450\n-&gt; 2001:20::/28Overlay Routable Cryptographic Hash Ids (ORCHIDv2)RFC7343\n-&gt; 2001:db8::/32Documentation/example only addressRFC3849\n-&gt; 2002::/166to4 tunnelingRFC3056\nf000::/5Reserved\nf800::/6Reserved\nfc00::/7Unique-Local UnicastRFC4193\nfe00::/9Reserved\nfe80::/10Link-Local UnicastRFC4291\nff00::/8MulticastRFC4291\n\nunique-local unicast address (ULA)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nlook for IPs starting with fd00::/8 as fc00::/8 is not currently allocated\nglobally unique (statistically), but not globally routable.\nthe \"Global ID\" is supposed to be randomly sampled.

In OSI model terms, they usually bridge L1 (Phyiscal Layer) and L2 (Data-link Layer), though some fancy NICs can handle the whole TCP/IP stack.\nMost consumer-grade hardware comes with a NIC integrated into the CPU or Motherboard. NICs can also be purchased separately and hooked up via the PCI bus.\nThese NICs are then typically connected via a physical Ethernet connection or provide wireless WiFi connection to a local router.\nNICs are abstracted away by the kernel with network interfaces for userspace applications to configure and consume.\nFor a simplified mental model, I like to think of a NIC as a set of receive (rx) queues and transmit (tx) queues for sending and receiving link-layer frames.\nThe tx/rx queues are typically FIFO ring-buffers. If you don't pull off frames fast enough or push too many frames at once, you'll start overwriting old frames : ).\nNICs typically provide a low-level interface or driver for the kernel (or more rarely, a userspace application) to pump outbound link-layer frames into the network and read inbound link-layer frames from the network.\nNICs are addressed via MAC addresses on the local physical network. MAC addresses need to be unique per local network, but aren't globally unique.\nKernel Bypass\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nUserspace applications can completely bypass the kernel and send/receive packets directly from a NIC. Doing this by hand would be quite tedious, as different NICs often have different APIs. People tend to use a library like DPDK (Data-Plane Development Kit) for this purpose. As for why you would want to do this, the answer is usually performance and control. Some exotic NICs or FPGA accelerators may also require bypassing the kernel to take full advantage.\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/networking/network interface card (NIC)/","title":"network interface card (NIC)"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/networking/network interfaces/":{"body":"network interfaces\n\nWikipedia: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Virtual_network_interface\nLet's start with some basic definitions. A network interface is a software interface over some:\n\nphyiscal networking hardware, like a network interface card (NIC). You'll see these named like eth0, eth5, radio0, wlan3.\nvirtual interface, like the \"loopback\" device or a WireGuard VPN tunnel.\n\nMost virtual interfaces wrap a lower physical interface or another virtual interface. One exception is the loopback interface lo which stands alone.\nWe have virtual interfaces to maximise flexibility when configuring our system.\nThese will look like lo, eth0:1, eth0.1, vlan2, br-lan, pppoe-dsl, gre0, sit0, tun0, imq0, teql0.\n\n\n\nHelpful Tip: Cloud machines will often present two virtual networking interfaces, one for public internet traffic and one for private VPC traffic.\nPhysical Network Interfaces\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEx: eth0, eth4, radio0, wlan2\n\nThese interfaces always represent an actual hardware device such as an Ethernet or Wireless NIC.\nPhysical network interfaces are provided by the kernel and presented to the user for configuration and consumption.\n\nVirtual Network Interfaces\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nLoopback\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEx: lo, lo0\n\nThe Loopback interface is provided by the kernel so applications can easily communicate with other local applications without any special code changes.\nAny traffic sent to the loopback IP is immediately passed back up the network stack as if it had been received from another device.\nThe IPv4 range 127.0.0.1/8 and IPv6 address ::1/128 both represent the loopback device.\nThe DNS name localhost is also a special name that resolves to 127.0.0.1 or ::1.\n\nVLANs\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEx: eth4.0, eth4.1, eth4.2, vlan0\n\nVirtual LANs let you partition a single link-layer (L2) network into multiple virtual L2 networks.\nVLANs let you decouple a user's network location from their physical location.\nVLANs let you separate and isolate network applications, despite sitting on the same physical network.\nVLANs let you group hosts together even if they're not directly connected to same network switch, simplifying network design and deployment.\nCloud hosts often use VLANs to provide customers with a single VPC network spanning multiple regions. Multiple customers can use the same physical links yet remain safely isolated.\nVLANs use the IEEE 802.1Q Ethernet frame header extension to \"tag\" each frame with its associated VLAN id. Since VLANs operate at L2, they let us support higher layers (L3+) transparently.\n\nStacked VLANs\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nCreate VLANs, inside VLANs, ..., inside VLANs : )\nUses IEEE 802.1ad to add multiple VLAN tags to ethernet frames.\n\nBridges\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEx: br0, br-lan\n\nNetwork Bridges make multiple physical or virtual network interfaces act as if they were just one network interface.\nIn some ways, bridges are the opposite of VLANs.\nFor example, my local OpenWRT router groups all LAN ethernet devices and wireless radios into one logical LAN interface, called br-lan. This way my phone and laptop can easily connect to my desktop, even though the first two connect over WiFi and the last connects over wired ethernet. From each device's perspective, the network looks like a single unified network.\nSee: Linux Foundation Wiki - bridge\n\nBonds\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEx: bond0\n\nNetwork Bonding allows you to combine multiple links into one big link for higher throughput or reliability.\n\nSee: Link Aggregation\n\n\nFor example, if you have two upstream eth interfaces that each support 50 Mbps throughput, you can bond them into one virtual eth interface with a maximum of 100 Mbps throughput.\n\nTunnels/Taps\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEx: pppoe-dsl, wg0, tun0, tunl0, tap2, vpn1, sit0\n\nTunnels let you send L3 packets or L2 frames over a Tunneling Protocol, usually to a remote host.\nFor example, WireGuard is a secure VPN protocol that provides a secure wg0 tunnel interface.\n\nIt lets you send standard L4 TCP/UDP/whatever packets over the wg0 tunnel to configured remote WireGuard peers.\nData sent through the tunnel is wrapped, encrypted, and sent over WireGuard's UDP protocol to the destination peer.\nWireGuard servers maintain a Cryptokey routing table that associates a pubkey and set of allowed source CIDRs for each peer.\n\n\nLinux TUN/TAP lets userspace programs provide virtual software network interfaces at L3 (TUN, IP packets) or L2 (TAP, Ethernet frames).\n\nTUN devices can be used to intercept and dump packets, provide a userspace-implemented VPN, relay packets over TOR, and much more!\nSee: Linux Foundation Wiki &gt; Tunneling\nSee: Linux Networking Documentation &gt; Universal TUN/TAP\nSee: https://www.gabriel.urdhr.fr/2021/05/08/tuntap/\n\n\n\nSpecial Purpose\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEx: icq0, teql0\n\nSome interfaces provide traffic shaping or load balancing functionality, like Intermediate Queueing Device (IMQ) for ingress shaping or True Link Equalizer which round-robins packets into 2-or-more interfaces.\n\n(Deprecated) Aliases\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEx: eth4:5, eth4:6\n\nBack in the day, Linux only supported one IP+mask per interface. Aliases are a way to present an existing interface with more than one IP+mask. Aliases are no longer necessary, but exist for backwards-compatibility reasons.\nSee: Linux Networking Documentation &gt; IP-Aliasing\n\nViewing the current network interfaces\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nOn a recent Linux kernel, you can easily view the available interfaces with ip addr.

The rows are grouped into pages (default: 8 KiB / page). Each row has its index in the heap, called the TID.\nTID\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe TID or tuple identifier is a 6-byte struct that describes the unique storage location for each row / tuple:\nstruct Tid {\n\t/// The index of the page in the heap containing this tuple.\n\tpage_idx: u32,\n\t/// The index of this tuple inside the page.\n\tin_page_idx: u16,\n}\n\nindex storage\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nEach index has its own storage separate from the heap, which stores only the values (columns, materialized values, etc...) contained by the index.

You write Make-like build targets, which can have dependencies on other targets. The contents of each build target is (effectively) a Dockerfile.\nThe ultimate goal is repeatable, reproducible builds. Repeat a failed build from CI. Seamlessly reproduce your developer environment on a colleague's machine. Etc etc...\nEarthly vs Nix\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nBoth use linux namespaces for isolation. Nix has an absolutely awful DSL language that I have to relearn every time I touch it. Earthfiles are significantly more imperative; they look like a list of Makefile targets with Dockerfile recipes.\nEarthly vs Buck / Bazel\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nBazel and Buck provide truely hermetic builds, but they each require complete control over the entire toolchain, so no using npm, cargo, etc... This is fine for Google/Facebook, but not for smaller teams (IMO).\nEarthly claims to strike a more pragmatic balance between truely repeatable and deterministic builds and productive development for a smaller team.\nDocs\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nIt appears build steps must explicitly mark files as \"artifacts\". You must then explicitly copy these artifacts over in dependent build steps.\nLikewise, output artifacts must be explicitly exported to the user's FS from the container FS.\nExported artifacts are not transitive, so if your dependency explicitly exports to the user's FS, your build step won't unless you also explicitly export.\nCan easily push artifacts to remote destinations, run db migrations, cut releases, etc... as a build step.\nLike normal Dockerfiles, an intermediate build step is cached as a new layer.\n\nThoughts\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nPros\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nSeems like a solid choice for a CI pipeline and devs occasionally reproducing CI runs locally.\nBuilds are nicely isolated from the dev machine, reducing implicit state that's actually necessary for builds to succeed.\nBuilds are (mostly) reproducible across environments. Though, my experience with a big Rust project was that this was not a problem.\nI love that build step inputs and outputs are marked explicitly. Following an unfamiliar Earthfile doesn't feel too bad.\nOnce you've set up a common development base image, all developers can share good quality tools and configuration without have to independently set up debuggers, profilers, etc...\nCan use a shared build cache like Bazel, Buck, or scc so beefy builds don't have to take forever. CI can also shared this build cache!\n\nCons\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nLike Docker, toolchains are stuck inside containers, usually in a way that is inaccessible to other dev tools, like IDEs, debuggers, profilers, etc...\nI worry that basic dev tools like running an LSP might be challenging to set up? Would this be like mounting the dev directory as a volume for the LSP service? Or is this not even a problem at all... idk. I don't use Docker frequently enough to know.\nSome weird idiosyncrasies, presumably due to the Docker layering model. Developers need a solid mental model to avoid committing egregiously large, slow, or uncacheable intermediate layers.\n\nExample: explicit caching of derived Cargo dependency state in first three build steps: https://github.com/earthly/earthly/blob/main/examples/rust/Earthfile\n\n\nRust has a nice enough runner (cargo) that you don't hit a lot of the reproducibility problems experienced in other languages *cough* C/C++.\nCaching is still too coarse-grained compared to running stateful native tools like cargo locally.\nUnlike Bazel or Buck, which take full control of the toolchain, it seems more likely to hit non-determinism with Earthly, since we're using language tools which typically don't know or care about reproducibility.\nGet to learn yet another fun and exciting DSL, with its own special and unique patterns and other miscellaneous weirdness.\nToo slow in tight development loop. On my beefy desktop, a no-op build takes at least 5s. On my M1 MBP, a no-op build takes at least 8-10s. This means any non-trivial build step has a minimum 8-10s duration, which is frankly unacceptable. Non-trivial file copying also adds significant overhead.\nMulti-platform builds (targetting amd64/linux) failed on my M1 Mac for inscrutable reasons. Most likely not earthly's fault, but an issue nonetheless.\nFeels unwieldy running integration tests that need access to low-level hardware devices. Our requirement is probably not typical though.\nRemote builder authentication uses mTLS certs. Provisioning these seems like a pain, esp. when I already have ssh secrets provisioned : (\nOverall, Earthly still feels a bit early.

It compiles the source code in a similar build environment and compares it to the official pre-built artifacts. This helps identify supply-chain compromises. This website hosts a list of public instances publishing their results.\nrebuilderd monitors the package repository of a linux distribution and uses rebuilder backends like archlinux-repro to verify the provided binary packages can be reproduced from the given source code.\nIt tracks the state of successfully verified packages and optionally generates a report of differences with diffoscope for debugging. Note that due to the early state of this technology a failed rebuild is more likely due to an undeterministic build process instead of a supply chain compromise, but if multiple rebuilders you trust report 100% reproducible for the set of packages you use you can be confident that the binaries on your system haven't been tampered with. People are encouraged to run their own rebuilders if they can afford to.\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/reproducible builds/rebuilderd/","title":"rebuilderd"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/reproducible builds/reproducible-builds.org/":{"body":"reproducible-builds.org\n\nWhy does it matter?\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWhilst anyone may inspect the source code of free and open source software for malicious flaws, most software is distributed pre-compiled with no method to confirm whether they correspond.\nThis incentivises attacks on developers who release software, not only via traditional exploitation, but also in the forms of political influence, blackmail or even threats of violence.\nThis is particularly a concern for developers collaborating on privacy or security software: attacking these typically result in compromising particularly politically-sensitive targets such as dissidents, journalists and whistleblowers, as well as anyone wishing to communicate securely under a repressive regime.\nWhilst individual developers are a natural target, it additionally encourages attacks on build infrastructure as a successful attack would provide access to a large number of downstream computer systems. By modifying the generated binaries here instead of modifying the upstream source code, illicit changes are essentially invisible to its original authors and users alike.\nThe motivation behind the Reproducible Builds project is therefore to allow verification that no vulnerabilities or backdoors have been introduced during this compilation process. By promising identical results are always generated from a given source, this allows multiple third parties to come to a consensus on a “correct” result, highlighting any deviations as suspect and worthy of scrutiny.\nThis ability to notice if a developer or build system has been compromised then prevents such threats or attacks occurring in the first place, as any compromise can be quickly detected. As a result, front-liners cannot be threatened/coerced into exploiting or exposing their colleagues.\nSeveral free software projects already, or will soon, provide reproducible builds.\nHow?\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nFirst, the build system needs to be made entirely deterministic: transforming a given source must always create the same result. For example, the current date and time must not be recorded and output always has to be written in the same order.\nSecond, the set of tools used to perform the build and more generally the build environment should either be recorded or pre-defined.\nThird, users should be given a way to recreate a close enough build environment, perform the build process, and validate that the output matches the original build.\nLearn more about how to make your software build reproducibly…\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/reproducible builds/reproducible-builds.org/","title":"reproducible-builds.org"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/":{"body":"","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/","title":"router"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/":{"body":"","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/","title":"router/lightning router"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/captive portal/":{"body":"","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/captive portal/","title":"router/lightning router/captive portal"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/captive portal/RFC 6585 (Additional HTTP Status Codes)/":{"body":"RFC 6585 (Additional HTTP Status Codes)\n\nInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF)                     M.

However, because clients will treat unknown status\ncodes as a generic error of the same class (e.g., 499 is treated as\n400 if it is not recognized), they can be safely deployed by existing\nservers (see [RFC2616] Section 6.1.1 for more information).\nRequirements\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n428 Precondition Required\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 428 status code indicates that the origin server requires the\nrequest to be conditional.\nIts typical use is to avoid the \"lost update\" problem, where a client\nGETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server,\nwhen meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server,\nleading to a conflict.  By requiring requests to be conditional, the\nserver can assure that clients are working with the correct copies.\nResponses using this status code SHOULD explain how to resubmit the\nrequest successfully.  For example:\nHTTP/1.1 428 Precondition Required\nContent-Type: text/html\n&lt;html&gt;\n   &lt;head&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;Precondition Required&lt;/title&gt;\n   &lt;/head&gt;\n   &lt;body&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;Precondition Required&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;This request is required to be conditional;\n      try using \"If-Match\".&lt;/p&gt;\n   &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nResponses with the 428 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\n429 Too Many Requests\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many\nrequests in a given amount of time (\"rate limiting\").\nThe response representations SHOULD include details explaining the\ncondition, and MAY include a Retry-After header indicating how long\nto wait before making a new request.\nFor example:\nHTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\nContent-Type: text/html\nRetry-After: 3600\n   &lt;html&gt;\n      &lt;head&gt;\n         &lt;title&gt;Too Many Requests&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;/head&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n         &lt;h1&gt;Too Many Requests&lt;/h1&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;I only allow 50 requests per hour to this Web site per\n            logged in user.  Try again soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n   &lt;/html&gt;\n\nNote that this specification does not define how the origin server\nidentifies the user, nor how it counts requests.  For example, an\norigin server that is limiting request rates can do so based upon\ncounts of requests on a per-resource basis, across the entire server,\nor even among a set of servers.  Likewise, it might identify the user\nby its authentication credentials, or a stateful cookie.\nResponses with the 429 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\n431 Request Header Fields Too Large\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 431 status code indicates that the server is unwilling to process\nthe request because its header fields are too large.  The request MAY\nbe resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.\nIt can be used both when the set of request header fields in total is\ntoo large, and when a single header field is at fault.  In the latter\ncase, the response representation SHOULD specify which header field\nwas too large.\nFor example:\nHTTP/1.1 431 Request Header Fields Too Large\nContent-Type: text/html\n   &lt;html&gt;\n      &lt;head&gt;\n         &lt;title&gt;Request Header Fields Too Large&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;/head&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n         &lt;h1&gt;Request Header Fields Too Large&lt;/h1&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;The \"Example\" header was too large.&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n   &lt;/html&gt;\n\nResponses with the 431 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\n511 Network Authentication Required ^8c7492\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate\nto gain network access.\nThe response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that\nallows the user to submit credentials (e.g., with an HTML form).\nNote that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the\nlogin interface itself, because browsers would show the login\ninterface as being associated with the originally requested URL,\nwhich may cause confusion.\nThe 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by origin servers; it is\nintended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a\nmeans of controlling access to the network.\nResponses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\nThe 511 Status Code and Captive Portals\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 511 status code is designed to mitigate problems caused by\n\"captive portals\" to software (especially non-browser agents) that is\nexpecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not\nthe intervening network infrastructure.  It is not intended to\nencourage deployment of captive portals -- only to limit the damage\ncaused by them.\nA network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance\nof terms, or other user interaction before granting access usually\ndoes so by identifying clients who have not done so (\"unknown\nclients\") using their Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. ^615a1d\nUnknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP\nport 80, which is sent to an HTTP server (the \"login server\")\ndedicated to \"logging in\" unknown clients, and of course traffic to\nthe login server itself. ^521ac1\n511 Captive Portal Example\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nFor example, a user agent might connect to a network and make the\nfollowing HTTP request on TCP port 80:\nGET /index.htm HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\n\nUpon receiving such a request, the login server would generate a 511\nresponse:\nHTTP/1.1 511 Network Authentication Required\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n   &lt;html&gt;\n      &lt;head&gt;\n         &lt;title&gt;Network Authentication Required&lt;/title&gt;\n         &lt;meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"\n               content=\"0; url=https://login.example.net/\"&gt;\n      &lt;/head&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;You need to &lt;a href=\"https://login.example.net/\"&gt;\n         authenticate with the local network&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain\n         access.&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n   &lt;/html&gt;\n\nHere, the 511 status code assures that non-browser clients will not\ninterpret the response as being from the origin server, and the META\nHTML element redirects the user agent to the login server.\nSecurity Considerations\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n428 Precondition Required\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 428 status code is optional; clients cannot rely upon its use to\nprevent \"lost update\" conflicts.\n429 Too Many Requests\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWhen a server is under attack or just receiving a very large number\nof requests from a single party, responding to each with a 429 status\ncode will consume resources.\nTherefore, servers are not required to use the 429 status code; when\nlimiting resource usage, it may be more appropriate to just drop\nconnections, or take other steps.\n431 Request Header Fields Too Large\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nServers are not required to use the 431 status code; when under\nattack, it may be more appropriate to just drop connections, or take\nother steps.\n511 Network Authentication Required (Security)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIn common use, a response carrying the 511 status code will not come\nfrom the origin server indicated in the request's URL.  This presents\nmany security issues; e.g., an attacking intermediary may be\ninserting cookies into the original domain's name space, may be\nobserving cookies or HTTP authentication credentials sent from the\nuser agent, and so on.\nHowever, these risks are not unique to the 511 status code; in other\nwords, a captive portal that is not using this status code introduces\nthe same issues.\nAlso, note that captive portals using this status code on a Secure\nSocket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection\n(commonly, port 443) will generate a certificate error on the client.\nIANA Considerations\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe HTTP Status Codes registry has been updated with the following\nentries:\n  Value: 428\n  Description: Precondition Required\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\n  Value: 429\n  Description: Too Many Requests\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\n  Value: 431\n  Description: Request Header Fields Too Large\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\n  Value: 511\n  Description: Network Authentication Required\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\nReferences\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n9.1.

Acknowledgements\n\nThanks to Jan Algermissen and Julian Reschke for their suggestions\nand feedback.\n\n### Appendix B.  Issues Raised by Captive Portals\n\nSince clients cannot differentiate between a portal's response and\nthat of the HTTP server that they intended to communicate with, a\nnumber of issues arise.  The 511 status code is intended to help\nmitigate some of them.\n\nOne example is the \"favicon.ico\" \\[Favicon\\] commonly used by browsers\nto identify the site being accessed.  If the favicon for a given site\nis fetched from a captive portal instead of the intended site (e.g.,\nbecause the user is unauthenticated), it will often \"stick\" in the\nbrowser's cache (most implementations cache favicons aggressively)\nbeyond the portal session, so that it seems as if the portal's\nfavicon has \"taken over\" the legitimate site.\n\nAnother browser-based issue comes about when the Platform for Privacy\nPreferences \\[P3P\\] is supported.  Depending on how it is implemented,\nit's possible a browser might interpret a portal's response for the\np3p.xml file as the server's, resulting in the privacy policy (or\nlack thereof) advertised by the portal being interpreted as applying\nto the intended site.  Other Web-based protocols such as WebFinger\n\\[WebFinger\\], Cross-Origin Resource Sharing \\[CORS\\], and Open\nAuthorization \\[OAuth2.0\\] may also be vulnerable to such issues.\n\nAlthough HTTP is most widely used with Web browsers, a growing number\nof non-browsing applications use it as a substrate protocol.  For\nexample, Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) \\[RFC4918\\]\nand Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV) \\[RFC4791\\] both use HTTP\nas the basis (for remote authoring and calendaring, respectively).\nUsing these applications from behind a captive portal can result in\nspurious errors being presented to the user, and might result in\ncontent corruption, in extreme cases.\n\nSimilarly, other non-browser applications using HTTP can be affected\nas well, e.g., widgets \\[WIDGETS\\], software updates, and other\nspecialized software such as Twitter clients and the iTunes Music\nStore.\n\nIt should be noted that it's sometimes believed that using HTTP\nredirection to direct traffic to the portal addresses these issues.\nHowever, since many of these uses \"follow\" redirects, this is not a\ngood solution.\n\nAuthors' Addresses\n\nMark Nottingham\nRackspace\n\nEMail: mnot@mnot.net\nURI:   http://www.mnot.net/\n\nRoy T.

The captive portal page can be used for various purposes, such as authenticating the guest using a user name and password, providing an acceptable use policy, or self registration with an email address.\nAuthentication Process\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nCaptive portal is a Layer 3 authentication, which requires that the devices connect to the network and obtain an IP address and related DNS information before authenticating through the captive portal. The following steps explain the entire captive portal process when the native ArubaOS is used for captive portal authentication:\n\nThe device that is associating to the guest SSID is assigned an initial role (guest-logon role in the example configuration). This initial role allows DHCP, so the user gets an IP address.\nThe user opens a browser and makes an HTTP (or HTTPS) request to some destination (for example,&nbsp;www.bbc.com).\nThe resolver in the device sends a DNS request to resolve the www.bbc.com. The initial role (guest-logon role) permits DNS services, so the resolver can communicate with the DNS server.\nThe DNS server replies with the correct address to www.bbc.com.\nThe resolver tells the browser which IP address to use based on the DNS reply.\nThe browser initiates a TCP connection to port 80 of the www.bbc.com address.\nThe controller intercepts the connection and spoofs the initial TCP handshakes of the HTTP process. At this moment, the client browser thinks it is communicating with the bbc.com server.\nWhen the browser sends the HTTP GET request for the web page, the controller replies saying that bbc.com has “temporarily moved” to https://securelogin.arubanetworks.com/[string that identifies client].\nThe browser closes the connection.\nThe browser attempts to connect with https://securelogin.arubanetworks.com/[string that identifies client], but it first needs to send a DNS request for the address.\nThe actual DNS server responds that it cannot resolve https://securelogin.arubanetworks.com, but the controller intercepts that reply and changes the packet to say that securelogin.arubanetworks.com is at the IP address of the controller itself. Remember that it is critical that the DNS server sends back a reply to the query. &nbsp;It is only then that the controller can spoof the reply back from the DNS server.&nbsp; Sending a DNS request without receiving a reply is not sufficient, since without a reply the controller will never help the client resolve securelogin.arubanetworks.com.\nThe browser initiates an HTTPS connection to address of controller, which responds with the captive portal login page, where the guest authenticates.\nAfter successful authentication, the user is assigned the post authentication role (auth-guest role in the example configuration). This is the default role in the captive portal profile.\nAfter authentication, the browser is redirected to bbc.com at the address originally resolved by the DNS. Alternatively, if a welcome page is configured, the browser is redirected to the welcome page.\nTo successfully redirect to the original web page the controller spoofs a reply from bbc.com to tell the client that bbc.com has “permanently moved” to bbc.com. This step corrects the “temporary relocation” that occurred as part of the captive portal login.\nThis causes the client to re-query DNS for the address of www.bbc.com.\nThe browser starts to communicate with the actual bbc.com server.\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/captive portal/arubanetworks captive portal/","title":"arubanetworks captive portal"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/captive portal/captive portal (wikipedia)/":{"body":"captive portal (wikipedia)\n\nConnected to:\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWi-Fi Web browser MAC address\nOverview\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA captive portal is a web page accessed with a web browser that is displayed to newly connected users of a Wi-Fi or wired network before they are granted broader access to network resources. Captive portals are commonly used to present a landing or log-in page which may require authentication, payment, acceptance of an end-user license agreement, acceptable use policy, survey completion, or other valid credentials that both the host and user agree to adhere by. Captive portals are used for a broad range of mobile and pedestrian broadband services – including cable and commercially provided Wi-Fi and home hotspots. A captive portal can also be used to provide access to enterprise or residential wired networks, such as apartment houses, hotel rooms, and business centers.\nThe captive portal is presented to the client and is stored either at the gateway or on a web server hosting the web page. Depending on the feature set of the gateway, websites or TCP ports can be white-listed so that the user would not have to interact with the captive portal in order to use them. The MAC address of attached clients can also be used to bypass the login process for specified devices.\nUses\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nCaptive portals are primarily used in open wireless networks where the users are shown a welcome message informing them of the conditions of access (allowed ports, liability, etc.). Administrators tend to do this so that their own users take responsibility for their actions and to avoid any legal responsibility. Whether this delegation of responsibility is legally valid is a matter of debate.[1][2]\nOften captive portals are used for marketing and commercial communication purposes. Access to the Internet over open Wi-Fi is prohibited until the user exchanges personal data by filling out a web-based registration form in a web browser. The web-based form either automatically opens in a web browser, or appears when the user opens a web browser and tries to visit any web page. In other words, the user is \"captive\" - unable to access the Internet freely until the user is granted access to the Internet and has \"completed\" the captive portal. This allows the provider of this service to display or send advertisements to users who connect to the Wi-Fi access point. This type of service is also sometimes known as \"social Wi-Fi\", as they may ask for a social network account to login (such as Facebook). Over the past few years, such social Wi-Fi captive portals have become commonplace with various companies offering marketing centered around Wi-Fi data collection.\nThe user can find many types of content in the captive portal, and it's frequent to allow access to the Internet in exchange for viewing content or performing a certain action (often, providing personal data to enable commercial contact); thus, the marketing use of the captive portal is a tool for lead generation (business contacts or potential clients).[citation needed]\nImplementation\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThere is more than one way to implement a captive portal.\nHTTP redirect\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA common method is to direct all World Wide Web traffic to a web server, which returns an HTTP redirect to a captive portal.[3] When a modern, internet-enabled device first connects to a network, it sends out an HTTP request to a detection URL predefined by its vendor and expects an HTTP status code 200 OK or 204 No Content. If the device receives a HTTP 200 status code, it assumes it has unlimited internet access. Captive portal prompts are displayed when you are able to manipulate this first HTTP message to return a HTTP status code of 302 (redirect) to the captive portal of your choice.[4][5] RFC&nbsp;6585 specifies 511 Network Authentication Required code.\nICMP redirect\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nClient traffic can also be redirected using ICMP redirect on the layer 3 level.\nRedirect by DNS\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWhen a client requests a World Wide Web resource, DNS is queried by the browser. In a captive portal, the firewall will make sure that only the DNS server(s) provided by the network's DHCP can be used by unauthenticated clients (or, alternatively, it will forward all DNS requests by unauthenticated clients to that DNS server). This DNS server will return the IP address of the captive portal page as a result of all DNS lookups.\nIn order to perform redirection by DNS the captive portal uses DNS hijacking to perform an action similar to a man-in-the-middle attack. To limit the impact of DNS poisoning, a TTL of 0 is typically used.\nLimitations\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSecurity\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nCaptive portals have been known to have incomplete firewall rule sets.[6]\nDNS tunneling\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIn some deployments, the rule set will route DNS requests from clients to the Internet, or the provided DNS server will fulfill arbitrary DNS requests from the client. This allows a client to bypass the captive portal and access the open Internet by tunneling arbitrary traffic within DNS packets.\nAutomatic submission\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSome captive portals may be configured to allow appropriately equipped user agents to detect the captive portal and automatically authenticate. User agents and supplemental applications such as Apple's Captive Portal Assistant can sometimes transparently bypass the display of captive portal content against the wishes of the service operator as long as they have access to correct credentials, or they may attempt to authenticate with incorrect or obsolete credentials, resulting in unintentional consequences such as accidental account locking.\nMAC spoofing\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nA captive portal that uses MAC addresses to track connected devices can sometimes be circumvented by re-using a MAC address of previously authenticated device. Once a device has been authenticated to the captive portal using a valid credentials, the gateway adds that device's MAC address to its \"whitelist\"; since MAC addresses can easily be spoofed, any other device can pretend to be the authenticated device and bypass the captive portal. Once the IP and MAC addresses of other connecting computers are found to be authenticated, any machine can spoof the MAC address and Internet Protocol (IP) address of the authenticated target, and be allowed a route through the gateway. For this reason some captive portal solutions created extended authentication mechanisms to limit the risk for usurpation.\nRequire Web Browser\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nCaptive portals often require the use of a web browser; this is usually the first application that users start after connected to the Internet, but users who first use an email client or other application that relies on the Internet may find the connection not working without explanation, and will then need to open a web browser to validate. This may be problematic for users who do not have any web browser installed on their operating system. It is however sometimes possible to use email and other facilities that do not rely on DNS (e.g. if the application specifies the connection IP rather than the hostname). A similar problem can occur if the client uses AJAX or joins the network with pages already loaded into its web browser, causing undefined behavior (for example, corrupt messages appear) when such a page tries HTTP requests to its origin server.\nSimilarly, as HTTPS connections cannot be redirected (at least not without triggering security warnings), a web browser that only attempts to access secure websites before being authorized by the captive portal will see those attempts fail without explanation (the usual symptom is that the intended website appears to be down or inaccessible).\nPlatforms that have Wi-Fi and a TCP/IP stack but do not have a web browser that supports HTTPS cannot use many captive portals. Such platforms include the Nintendo DS running a game that uses Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Non-browser authentication is possible using WISPr, an XML-based authentication protocol for this purpose, or MAC-based authentication or authentications based on other protocols.\nIt is also possible for a platform vendor to enter into a service contract with the operator of a large number of captive portal hotspots to allow free or discounted access to the platform vendor's servers via the hotspot's walled garden. For example, in 2005 Nintendo and Wayport partnered to provide free Wi-Fi access to Nintendo DS users at certain McDonald's restaurants.[7] Also, VoIP SIP ports could be allowed to bypass the gateway to allow phones to work.\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/captive portal/captive portal (wikipedia)/","title":"captive portal (wikipedia)"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/captive portal/captive portal/":{"body":"captive portal\n\ncaptive portal (wikipedia)\nRFC 6585 (Additional HTTP Status Codes) &gt; 511 Network Authentication Required 8c7492\nRFC 6585 (Additional HTTP Status Codes)\n\nInternet Engineering Task Force (IETF)                     M.

However, because clients will treat unknown status\ncodes as a generic error of the same class (e.g., 499 is treated as\n400 if it is not recognized), they can be safely deployed by existing\nservers (see [RFC2616] Section 6.1.1 for more information).\nRequirements\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].\n428 Precondition Required\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 428 status code indicates that the origin server requires the\nrequest to be conditional.\nIts typical use is to avoid the \"lost update\" problem, where a client\nGETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server,\nwhen meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server,\nleading to a conflict.  By requiring requests to be conditional, the\nserver can assure that clients are working with the correct copies.\nResponses using this status code SHOULD explain how to resubmit the\nrequest successfully.  For example:\nHTTP/1.1 428 Precondition Required\nContent-Type: text/html\n&lt;html&gt;\n   &lt;head&gt;\n      &lt;title&gt;Precondition Required&lt;/title&gt;\n   &lt;/head&gt;\n   &lt;body&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;Precondition Required&lt;/h1&gt;\n      &lt;p&gt;This request is required to be conditional;\n      try using \"If-Match\".&lt;/p&gt;\n   &lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\nResponses with the 428 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\n429 Too Many Requests\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many\nrequests in a given amount of time (\"rate limiting\").\nThe response representations SHOULD include details explaining the\ncondition, and MAY include a Retry-After header indicating how long\nto wait before making a new request.\nFor example:\nHTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\nContent-Type: text/html\nRetry-After: 3600\n   &lt;html&gt;\n      &lt;head&gt;\n         &lt;title&gt;Too Many Requests&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;/head&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n         &lt;h1&gt;Too Many Requests&lt;/h1&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;I only allow 50 requests per hour to this Web site per\n            logged in user.  Try again soon.&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n   &lt;/html&gt;\n\nNote that this specification does not define how the origin server\nidentifies the user, nor how it counts requests.  For example, an\norigin server that is limiting request rates can do so based upon\ncounts of requests on a per-resource basis, across the entire server,\nor even among a set of servers.  Likewise, it might identify the user\nby its authentication credentials, or a stateful cookie.\nResponses with the 429 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\n431 Request Header Fields Too Large\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 431 status code indicates that the server is unwilling to process\nthe request because its header fields are too large.  The request MAY\nbe resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.\nIt can be used both when the set of request header fields in total is\ntoo large, and when a single header field is at fault.  In the latter\ncase, the response representation SHOULD specify which header field\nwas too large.\nFor example:\nHTTP/1.1 431 Request Header Fields Too Large\nContent-Type: text/html\n   &lt;html&gt;\n      &lt;head&gt;\n         &lt;title&gt;Request Header Fields Too Large&lt;/title&gt;\n      &lt;/head&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n         &lt;h1&gt;Request Header Fields Too Large&lt;/h1&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;The \"Example\" header was too large.&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n   &lt;/html&gt;\n\nResponses with the 431 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\n511 Network Authentication Required ^8c7492\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate\nto gain network access.\nThe response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that\nallows the user to submit credentials (e.g., with an HTML form).\nNote that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the\nlogin interface itself, because browsers would show the login\ninterface as being associated with the originally requested URL,\nwhich may cause confusion.\nThe 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by origin servers; it is\nintended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a\nmeans of controlling access to the network.\nResponses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\nThe 511 Status Code and Captive Portals\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 511 status code is designed to mitigate problems caused by\n\"captive portals\" to software (especially non-browser agents) that is\nexpecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not\nthe intervening network infrastructure.  It is not intended to\nencourage deployment of captive portals -- only to limit the damage\ncaused by them.\nA network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance\nof terms, or other user interaction before granting access usually\ndoes so by identifying clients who have not done so (\"unknown\nclients\") using their Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. ^615a1d\nUnknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP\nport 80, which is sent to an HTTP server (the \"login server\")\ndedicated to \"logging in\" unknown clients, and of course traffic to\nthe login server itself. ^521ac1\n511 Captive Portal Example\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nFor example, a user agent might connect to a network and make the\nfollowing HTTP request on TCP port 80:\nGET /index.htm HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\n\nUpon receiving such a request, the login server would generate a 511\nresponse:\nHTTP/1.1 511 Network Authentication Required\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n   &lt;html&gt;\n      &lt;head&gt;\n         &lt;title&gt;Network Authentication Required&lt;/title&gt;\n         &lt;meta http-equiv=\"refresh\"\n               content=\"0; url=https://login.example.net/\"&gt;\n      &lt;/head&gt;\n      &lt;body&gt;\n         &lt;p&gt;You need to &lt;a href=\"https://login.example.net/\"&gt;\n         authenticate with the local network&lt;/a&gt; in order to gain\n         access.&lt;/p&gt;\n      &lt;/body&gt;\n   &lt;/html&gt;\n\nHere, the 511 status code assures that non-browser clients will not\ninterpret the response as being from the origin server, and the META\nHTML element redirects the user agent to the login server.\nSecurity Considerations\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n428 Precondition Required\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe 428 status code is optional; clients cannot rely upon its use to\nprevent \"lost update\" conflicts.\n429 Too Many Requests\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nWhen a server is under attack or just receiving a very large number\nof requests from a single party, responding to each with a 429 status\ncode will consume resources.\nTherefore, servers are not required to use the 429 status code; when\nlimiting resource usage, it may be more appropriate to just drop\nconnections, or take other steps.\n431 Request Header Fields Too Large\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nServers are not required to use the 431 status code; when under\nattack, it may be more appropriate to just drop connections, or take\nother steps.\n511 Network Authentication Required (Security)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nIn common use, a response carrying the 511 status code will not come\nfrom the origin server indicated in the request's URL.  This presents\nmany security issues; e.g., an attacking intermediary may be\ninserting cookies into the original domain's name space, may be\nobserving cookies or HTTP authentication credentials sent from the\nuser agent, and so on.\nHowever, these risks are not unique to the 511 status code; in other\nwords, a captive portal that is not using this status code introduces\nthe same issues.\nAlso, note that captive portals using this status code on a Secure\nSocket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection\n(commonly, port 443) will generate a certificate error on the client.\nIANA Considerations\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nThe HTTP Status Codes registry has been updated with the following\nentries:\n  Value: 428\n  Description: Precondition Required\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\n  Value: 429\n  Description: Too Many Requests\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\n  Value: 431\n  Description: Request Header Fields Too Large\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\n  Value: 511\n  Description: Network Authentication Required\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\nReferences\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n9.1.

However, because clients will treat unknown status\ncodes as a generic error of the same class (e.g., 499 is treated as\n400 if it is not recognized), they can be safely deployed by existing\nservers (see \\[RFC2616\\] Section 6.1.1 for more information).\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\",\n\"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this\ndocument are to be interpreted as described in \\[RFC2119\\].\n\n## 428 Precondition Required\n\nThe 428 status code indicates that the origin server requires the\nrequest to be conditional.\n\nIts typical use is to avoid the \"lost update\" problem, where a client\nGETs a resource's state, modifies it, and PUTs it back to the server,\nwhen meanwhile a third party has modified the state on the server,\nleading to a conflict.  By requiring requests to be conditional, the\nserver can assure that clients are working with the correct copies.\n\nResponses using this status code SHOULD explain how to resubmit the\nrequest successfully.  For example:\n\nHTTP/1.1 428 Precondition Required\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n````html\n\n   \n      Precondition Required\n   \n   \n      Precondition Required\n      This request is required to be conditional;\n      try using \"If-Match\".\n   \n\n````\n\nResponses with the 428 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\n\n## 429 Too Many Requests\n\nThe 429 status code indicates that the user has sent too many\nrequests in a given amount of time (\"rate limiting\").\n\nThe response representations SHOULD include details explaining the\ncondition, and MAY include a Retry-After header indicating how long\nto wait before making a new request.\n\nFor example:\n\nHTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\nContent-Type: text/html\nRetry-After: 3600\n\n````html\n   \n      \n         Too Many Requests\n      \n      \n         Too Many Requests\n         I only allow 50 requests per hour to this Web site per\n            logged in user.  Try again soon.\n      \n   \n````\n\nNote that this specification does not define how the origin server\nidentifies the user, nor how it counts requests.  For example, an\norigin server that is limiting request rates can do so based upon\ncounts of requests on a per-resource basis, across the entire server,\nor even among a set of servers.  Likewise, it might identify the user\nby its authentication credentials, or a stateful cookie.\n\nResponses with the 429 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\n\n## 431 Request Header Fields Too Large\n\nThe 431 status code indicates that the server is unwilling to process\nthe request because its header fields are too large.  The request MAY\nbe resubmitted after reducing the size of the request header fields.\n\nIt can be used both when the set of request header fields in total is\ntoo large, and when a single header field is at fault.  In the latter\ncase, the response representation SHOULD specify which header field\nwas too large.\n\nFor example:\n\nHTTP/1.1 431 Request Header Fields Too Large\nContent-Type: text/html\n\n````html\n   \n      \n         Request Header Fields Too Large\n      \n      \n         Request Header Fields Too Large\n         The \"Example\" header was too large.\n      \n   \n````\n\nResponses with the 431 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\n\n## 511 Network Authentication Required ^8c7492\n\nThe 511 status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate\nto gain network access.\n\nThe response representation SHOULD contain a link to a resource that\nallows the user to submit credentials (e.g., with an HTML form).\n\nNote that the 511 response SHOULD NOT contain a challenge or the\nlogin interface itself, because browsers would show the login\ninterface as being associated with the originally requested URL,\nwhich may cause confusion.\n\nThe 511 status SHOULD NOT be generated by origin servers; it is\nintended for use by intercepting proxies that are interposed as a\nmeans of controlling access to the network.\n\nResponses with the 511 status code MUST NOT be stored by a cache.\n\n### The 511 Status Code and Captive Portals\n\nThe 511 status code is designed to mitigate problems caused by\n\"captive portals\" to software (especially non-browser agents) that is\nexpecting a response from the server that a request was made to, not\nthe intervening network infrastructure.  It is not intended to\nencourage deployment of captive portals -- only to limit the damage\ncaused by them.\n\nA network operator wishing to require some authentication, acceptance\nof terms, or other user interaction before granting access usually\ndoes so by identifying clients who have not done so (\"unknown\nclients\") using their Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. ^615a1d\n\nUnknown clients then have all traffic blocked, except for that on TCP\nport 80, which is sent to an HTTP server (the \"login server\")\ndedicated to \"logging in\" unknown clients, and of course traffic to\nthe login server itself. ^521ac1\n\n#### 511 Captive Portal Example\n\nFor example, a user agent might connect to a network and make the\nfollowing HTTP request on TCP port 80:\n\n````http\nGET /index.htm HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\n````\n\nUpon receiving such a request, the login server would generate a 511\nresponse:\n\n````http\nHTTP/1.1 511 Network Authentication Required\nContent-Type: text/html\n````\n\n````html\n   \n      \n         Network Authentication Required\n         \n      \n      \n         You need to \n         authenticate with the local network in order to gain\n         access.\n      \n   \n````\n\nHere, the 511 status code assures that non-browser clients will not\ninterpret the response as being from the origin server, and the META\nHTML element redirects the user agent to the login server.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\n### 428 Precondition Required\n\nThe 428 status code is optional; clients cannot rely upon its use to\nprevent \"lost update\" conflicts.\n\n### 429 Too Many Requests\n\nWhen a server is under attack or just receiving a very large number\nof requests from a single party, responding to each with a 429 status\ncode will consume resources.\n\nTherefore, servers are not required to use the 429 status code; when\nlimiting resource usage, it may be more appropriate to just drop\nconnections, or take other steps.\n\n### 431 Request Header Fields Too Large\n\nServers are not required to use the 431 status code; when under\nattack, it may be more appropriate to just drop connections, or take\nother steps.\n\n### 511 Network Authentication Required (Security)\n\nIn common use, a response carrying the 511 status code will not come\nfrom the origin server indicated in the request's URL.  This presents\nmany security issues; e.g., an attacking intermediary may be\ninserting cookies into the original domain's name space, may be\nobserving cookies or HTTP authentication credentials sent from the\nuser agent, and so on.\n\nHowever, these risks are not unique to the 511 status code; in other\nwords, a captive portal that is not using this status code introduces\nthe same issues.\n\nAlso, note that captive portals using this status code on a Secure\nSocket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection\n(commonly, port 443) will generate a certificate error on the client.\n\n## IANA Considerations\n\nThe HTTP Status Codes registry has been updated with the following\nentries:\n\n````\n  Value: 428\n  Description: Precondition Required\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\n  Value: 429\n  Description: Too Many Requests\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\n  Value: 431\n  Description: Request Header Fields Too Large\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n\n  Value: 511\n  Description: Network Authentication Required\n  Reference: [RFC6585]\n````\n\n## References\n\n9.1.

WiFi Passpoint (Hotspot 2.0)\n\n### 2. [HTTP Redirect](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Captive_portal#/HTTP_redirect)\n\nWhen client device first connects, it makes an HTTP request to a special endpoint (what?); if the endpoint returns 200 or 204, then it assume unlimited internet. Otherwise, if it returns 302 (redirect) to the captive portal, the device will know that it needs to auth to gain access.\n\nAlternatively, ALL HTTP requests from the client are redirected until auth'ed.\n\nProblem: How does this work when the client is HTTPS only?\n\n#### ArubaNetworks Example\n\n[arubanetworks captive portal](@/router/lightning%20router/captive%20portal/arubanetworks%20captive%20portal.md)\n\n#### HTTP 302 Redirect Example:\n\n````http\n# Client request:\nGET /index.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\n\n# Server response:\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nLocation: http://www.iana.org/domains/example/\n````\n\n#### HTTP 511 Example:\n\n#### 511 Captive Portal Example\n\nFor example, a user agent might connect to a network and make the\nfollowing HTTP request on TCP port 80:\n\n````http\nGET /index.htm HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.com\n````\n\nUpon receiving such a request, the login server would generate a 511\nresponse:\n\n````http\nHTTP/1.1 511 Network Authentication Required\nContent-Type: text/html\n````\n\n````html\n   \n      \n         Network Authentication Required\n         \n      \n      \n         You need to \n         authenticate with the local network in order to gain\n         access.\n      \n   \n````\n\nHere, the 511 status code assures that non-browser clients will not\ninterpret the response as being from the origin server, and the META\nHTML element redirects the user agent to the login server.\n\n### 3. ICMP Redirect\n\nTODO\n\n### 4. DNS Redirect\n\nUse [DNS Hijacking](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/DNS_hijacking) to return IP of captive portal for all DNS requests until client is auth'ed.\n\nDNS response should use TTL=0 to avoid poisoning client's DNS cache.\n\nProblem: how does this work if the client has their own DNS server configured (e.g. 8.8.8.8)? Could do DNS packet rewriting I guess...\n\nProblem: when the client looks up `google.com`, what if their local DNS cache is already hot? They will never make a DNS request that we can rewrite.\n\\]\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/captive portal/captive portal/","title":"captive portal"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/router/lightning router/lightning router overview/":{"body":"lightning router overview\n\nLightning-enabled \"Captive Portal\"\n\"Pay-as-you-go\" internet usage with Lightning\nThesis\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nFaster, cheaper micro-payments enable finer grained usage billing\nUse Cases\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nCafe / Restaurant / Hotel / Airport\nAppartment: provide WiFi to neighbors\n\nWhat is Purchased (Capacity vs Volume)\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nOne of:\n\nData Volume\n+ Users purchase a \"data rate\" contract, e.g., $0.01 / MiB, charged every X MiB\n+ Most cost efficient (?), since users pay only for what they use\n+ Provider can charge many users at once\n+ Variable quality, since it makes no guarantees about how much bandwidth capacity you're getting\n+ Good for: emails, browsing, \"spiky\" usage\nBandwidth\n+ Users purchase a \"bandwidth capacity\" contract, e.g., 10 MiB/s, charged every X minutes\n+ Allows users to reserve a \"slice of the pipe\" all to themselves\n+ Some use cases aren't usable without a minimum bandwidth guarantee (Youtube video buffering, gaming lag).

By normalizing the interval bounds in terms of the standard normal distribution, we can see\n\\[\nPr[failure] = 2 \\cdot \\Phi\\left(\\frac{(\\mu - E) - \\mu}{\\sigma_{\\mu_x}} \\right) = 2 \\cdot \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-E}{\\sigma_{\\mu_x}} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere $\\Phi$ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution. Given a desired $p_f = Pr[failure]$, we can compute the error bounds $E$\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\tp_f &amp;= 2 \\cdot \\Phi\\left(\\frac{-E}{\\sigma_{\\mu_x}} \\right) \\\\\n\t\\frac{-E}{\\sigma_{\\mu_x}} &amp;= \\Phi^{-1}(p_f / 2) \\\\\n\tE &amp;= -\\sigma_{\\mu_x} \\cdot \\Phi^{-1}(p_f / 2) \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nOf course, it can be annoying to compute the inverse normal CDF, so it's often useful to frame $p_f$ in terms of the Z-score, or \"standard sigma's from the mean (0)\". There's a convenient table above, showing the Z-value alongside the $1-p_f$ success probability for a few values.\nFor example, if our standard error of the mean is $\\sigma_{\\mu_x} = 50$ and our desired confidence is $\\sigma_{std} = 5.0$, then our error bound is $E = \\sigma_{\\mu_x} \\cdot \\sigma_{std} = 250$.\nIf we take more samples, our SME might only be $\\sigma_{\\mu_x} = 15$. For the same confidence, our required error bounds would only be $E = 75$.\nLikewise, if we decrease our desired confidence to only $\\sigma_{std} = 1.5$ while our $\\sigma_{\\mu_x} = 50$, the required error bounds are also $E = 75$.\nIntuitions\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\n\nTake more samples to allow tighter error tolerance or allow lower required confidence (for the same failure probabilty).\nUsing a very high required confidence can make your absolute error bound very large, which might mean you are not really saying much about the sample distribution.\n\n","id":"https://phlip9.com/notes/statistics probability/testing whether a coin is fair/","title":"testing whether a coin is fair"},"https://phlip9.com/notes/statistics probability/winsorize/":{"body":"winsorize\n\nSource: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Winsorizing\nCheap way to remove outliers from samples.\n\nTL;DR: winsorize(X, q in [0,0.5]) replaces all elements in X below quantile q and above quantile 1-q with the quantile q and 1-q respectively.\nJust clamps outliers above and below a quantile.\nEffectively removes outliers without changing the number of samples (length of X).\nUsed in cargo's default bench harness when taking timing samples.\n\nExample Implementation\n  \n    #\n  \n\n\nSource: https://github.com/phlip9/idris2-aoc21/blob/master/src/Bench.idr\nimport Data.List\nimport Data.List1\nimport Data.String\nimport Data.Vec\nimport Scratch\nimport System.Clock\nimport System.Random\n\n%default total\n\n||| Clamp `x` to the range `[min, max]`.
